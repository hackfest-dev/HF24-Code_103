His son is very junior, un-professional, in-human, rude, illiterate, careless, has no human value. We cannot even call him a doctor with his behavior. I almost lost my father because of his mistake!!\n\nThey spoilt my father's case, created fistula (a hole in the food-pipe) during endoscopy-dilation and did not even inform us. When we went to him again he did some swallow test which worsened my fathers condition and left my father choking, breathless and extreme coughing - my father was in a dying condition.. Dr. Sukrit did not take any preventive action, he didnt even give the report of the test and told us very rudely that he cannot do anything and asked us to take our father away (in a condition where other doctor would have called for critical response team). Maybe he got frightened because he found about the fistula in the test and wanted to shoo us away.\nHow come a son is practicing under his father in the same hospital? This is clear conflict of interest. Father being the mentor will never acknowledge/agree to his Son's mistakes. Maybe Sukrit just got some degree using his father's reference/money.\nOverall pathetic experience with Medanta because of all this."

After surgery of my ear, same has been infected ,blood comes out from ear & there become 2 hole in newly inserted ear drum. I had again consulted him several times but he only provides ear drop without giving antibiotic medicine for healing infection of my ear. When I asked about why my ear surgery failed, he provide several excuses like not to do surgery in the rainy season and so on along with advice to do again same surgery of my same ear but he did not inform me of anything like this before surgery.\n\nThen i visited a different doctor who told me that Dr. PL Dhingra has made mistakes  while doing surgery that he did not eradicate infection of the inner bone of my ear and just changed the ear drum( Kan ka jali) and also Dr. PL Dhingra did not suggest me to do CT scan of my ear although there was a main problem in my ear instead of my nose (just like CT scan of brain in the fracture of bone of leg)\n\nNowadays Dr. PL Dhingra is just taking money from patients and not treating them well (Rs 2000 per visit)...seems like he is just fooling people by his polite and soft behaviour.....I wasted my Rs 1,80,000/-  and 3 months just because of his bad treatment.\n\nSo, please do not visit him by seeing his vast experience like I visited and suffer because of his bad treatment"

He made sure that I understand the issue and gave me a broader picture about the upcoming lifestyle changes and disease Management. Dr Dinesh is also a very humble and amazing doctor and am sure he will be an asset to wherever he works. The entire team of Dr Renjen especially Rakesh are commendable.

It is typically done to treat conditions such as heart valve disease, coronary artery disease, and congenital heart defects. The success of the surgery depends on a number of factors, including the skill and experience of the surgeon.\n\nWhen choosing a doctor to perform open heart surgery, it is important to look for someone who has the necessary training and credentials, as well as a track record of success in performing the procedure. You may also want to consider factors such as the doctor's communication style, bedside manner, and willingness to answer your questions and address your concerns.\n\nIn addition to selecting a skilled and experienced surgeon, it is also important to choose a hospital that has a strong reputation for cardiac care and a comprehensive support team, including nurses, anesthesiologists, and other healthcare professionals.\n\nUltimately, the success of open heart surgery depends on a number of factors, including the skill and experience of the surgeon, the quality of the medical team and facilities, and the overall health of the patient. If you have concerns about your experience with a particular doctor or surgical team, it is important to discuss your concerns with your healthcare provider and seek additional medical advice as needed.\nI advice one of the best doctor is dr.

In Mumbai's top hospitals with a friends reference.\nI fail to understand how can someone give negative feedbacks as seen on social websites..\n\nHe is the most down to earth and genuine urologist one can find. I had been diagnosed with kidney stones and had to get them removed. He was very clear in diagnosis and treatment plan during the consultation itself. Had no second thoughts , that he is going to be my treating Dr.\n\nOn admission he and his team Dr. Annirudh Desai took good care and made sure I stay calm before and after the procedure. RIRS was performed which was very mush successful i believe as I did not encounter any severe post operative pain or discomfort even with the stent in place.\n\nRemoval of Stent was even smoother and matter of seconds was completed under LA.\n\nHe epitomises a perfect surgeon and moreso a nobel Human being..\n\nDont get influenced by his years of experience and picture above... He is as young and energetic as a 50 year old man...\n\nWill highly recommend him!!!"

Prior to that we had done FNAC test to ascertain if the problem is related to gland TB. This doctor advised to go for a surgery which is a major one.\nRather than following his advice blindly, I paused the treatment process there and moved to Apollo Hospital, Chennai.\n\nThe doctor at Apollo said that, he would try to treat the issue with medicine. Because, the surgery would be very very risky and life threatening. So, that is my experience with this  business minded doctor who cares only for the nursing home he works at and not the patient.\n\nMy advice to this gentleman is that he should sit in a meat shop with a dagger in his hand rather than sitting in a doctor's chair.

As my uncle's age was not permit for surgery we depend on medication. After 1year (more/less) treatment my uncle recovered completely. Naturally he stated to depend on Dr S.N Basak blindly. He was too much obedient patient and always keep in touch with doctors. Doctors suggest to do pet scan every year and my uncle did the same accordingly. After Dec'2022 problem raised again and my uncle went to doctor but he said report is good and there has no problem seen, difficulties continued to increased. In April'23 Dr. S N Basak admit that malignancy come back according to Pet scan report Dec'2022 by then, my uncle's health had worsened. We did not get any help and as well as guide from Dr S.N.Basak and his behavior was too rude and hopeless. Everytime when my uncle went for check up, he told \" I have saved you 4 years, you are not supposed to live this long\". Whatever, we started treatment again under Dr S N Basak dated 12.06.2023, we can't able to moving out from him as my uncle biased and trusted on him blindly. My uncle discharged from hospital on 16.06.2023 but there was no improvement and his health condition started getting worse. on 23.06.2023 my uncle went to Dr S N Basak for check up, doctor told his patient (my uncle) directly that, \"he will not survive further and advice to take mental preparation, ask to complete all doings as he has no time\". I have never heard a doctor to tell a patient directly that he/she will not live long and nothing to do. After that, my uncle totally devastated with his word as he depends on him like \"GOD\" and passed away on 30.06.2023.   This is my humble request please think many times before go to Dr S N Basak for treatment...He only knows money nothing else."

From the moment we stepped into his office, he greeted us with a dismissive demeanor, as if our concerns were insignificant and he had more important matters to attend to. His cold and condescending behavior left us feeling like mere inconveniences rather than human beings desperately seeking guidance and support during a difficult time.\n\nBut what truly sealed Dr. Basak's reputation as the worst oncologist imaginable was his complete disregard for my father's well-being. Instead of providing hope, empathy, or even a shred of optimism, he callously shattered any remaining positivity my father had left. He delivered the news of my father's prognosis in a cold and detached manner, leaving us feeling utterly hopeless and defeated. Rather than exploring treatment options or discussing potential avenues for support, he swiftly dismissed any possibility of recovery, leaving us in a state of shock and despair.\n\nTo make matters worse, it became painfully clear that Dr. Basak's primary motivation was money, not the well-being of his patients.\nIn conclusion, Dr. SK Basak is an oncologist who should be avoided at all costs. His rude and unprofessional demeanor, lack of compassion, and money-driven approach make him utterly unsuited for the critical and sensitive field of oncology. Our experience with him was nothing short of a nightmare, and I would strongly advise anyone seeking quality care for themselves or their loved ones to steer clear of this doctor."

When we asked about surgery , he was like what Surgery ? You are in way fit for CABG    He told We will be doing  lots test on the same day of my first consultation  The way he spoke literally  , as if I would die on the surgery table itself for 99.9%. He indirectly told  since i am Responsible  for my health condition so now I better pay . Probably what he told was truth about success  rate but the way he put  it across was very bad and Dirty . I had lots of other complications and so developed Blockage quickly he failed to understand  that while other doc understood the same. Now I am still alive without surgery and taking medicines . He told all negative things and kept on  blaming  me for the condition while I consulted other cardiologist  surgeon in Gangaram and Escorts but they sounded so positive and they told not to worry . Infact the Dr. At gangaram was really too good . A very postive mind and very good attitude he had. The first doc in I dia to have done heart transplant  in a private hospital. He obviously knew how to make you feel relaxed and Confident  . Apollo is shopping mall of Doc. Never visit Apollo . Better go to Ganaga Ram or to escorts"

I was admitted at Kokilaben hospital for some other issues.That time somehow my face turned red. He came to visit me as a skin specialist. Seeing him I got scared and even told him that he had damaged my skin before.  Anyway this time he prescribed one steroid medicine but never told me to stop this medicine after one month. Without knowing anything I continuously applied that medicine and got black spots on my face. Last week I went to visit him he said I had to stop that medicine after one month. Then he prescribed that same sunscreen lotion and medicine that made my face black again. He made it like 1000 times worse. And on top of that He has a lot of attitude.

Believe me, It is easier said than done!\nThe Operation went really well considering the other health issues he had. He is recovering well under Dr Raju Vyas\u2019 treatment & guidance.

After the initial examination, we discovered that he'd suffered an acute heart attack and needed an open-heart bypass surgery due to high blockage in his arteries. Dr. Raju Vyas took my father's case in his hands and despite the risks involved, performed the surgery the following day. Our family was extremely distressed, but to our delight, the surgery was successful, and Dr. Vyas saved my father's life. I'm very impressed by Dr. Vyas's unique approach to treating patients, and unlike other senior doctors, he is always accessible. After three months, my father has fully recovered  and his recent Echo report serves as proof of his successful recovery. I'm grateful to Dr. Vyas for giving my father a second chance at life and for his helpful guidance and suggestions throughout the entire process.

He advised medication for both diabetes and hypertension - without considering that the hypertension was a symptom.  He said the medication would be lifelong. The medication was so strong that she was dizzy and uncomfortable - till an alternate doctor reduced her medication and stopped the hypertension medication completely.\n\n3. After his \u201cconsultation\u201d this megalomaniac referred her to his \u201cdietician\u201d.  Who immediately recommended that she should lose 10 kg.  My wife was quite thin and weighed 55 Kg at the time - and would have disappeared if she lost 10kg. Obviously incompetent hires incompetent.\n\n4. Go to anyone else if you want to have your diabetes \u201ccured\u201d.

Those minute complications has caused my patient septic shock and she is now in death bed. They are not doctors they are just here to do business. I request everyone to not admit your patient under this worthless irresponsible doctor.

Ronen sir checked my mother, suggested some tests and after seeing the test results he suggested for TKR (Total Knee Replacement) for both knees. Operation was done successfully on 28th Feb 2023 and 4th March 2023. Physiotherapists under Ronen Sir guidance helped my mother to start walking from next day of the surgery. After 8 days my mother was discharged and physiotherapy started in home. I would recommend Dr Ronen Roy to everybody as I did not hear any wrong feedback from the surgeries he had done.

We requested him a lot to check my mother but he didn't paid any heed to our request. My mother is an arthritis and systematic sclerosis patient, with so much pain she somehow managed to reach the dr but he did not even show any pity. Is this the behaviour of an educated doctor? His attitude was more important for him than his patient. Such a unprofessional behaviour is not expected from such a senior  Dr like him.

I was very worried about the surgery as the general surgeon I first consulted mentioned it would be a critical surgery and that I might even have jaundice.\n\nHowever, after hearing about Dr. Debashis Deb, I went for a consultation with him on 26th January. He saw my reports and immediately admitted me for the surgery, which he performed on 30th January at K.D. Cure Nursing Home.\n\nDuring the laparoscopic surgery, there were moments where the procedure seemed impossible due to the severe inflammation of my gallbladder. But, Dr. Debashis Deb's expertise and experience helped him to successfully complete the laparoscopic surgery and remove my gallbladder and the stone.\nThe surgery was successful and got released the next day.\n\nI was amazed by the care and attention that Dr. Debashis Deb showed throughout the entire process. He made sure that I was comfortable and answered all of my questions. He even checked on me after the surgery and was always available to answer my messages on WhatsApp.\n\nI am truly grateful for Dr. Debashis Deb's help and would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a gallbladder surgery. He is truly a blessing and a highly skilled and experienced surgeon. I cannot thank him enough for his kindness and professionalism.\n\nBless Dr. Debashis Deb for his amazing work \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude4f"

We visited Dr Geeta Malkan Billa after the scheduled Gastroscopy for my mother followed by OPD.\nWe discussed the findings in the reports she has suggested and also she has prescribed the medicines for diabetic and gastrology problems to my mother.\nIn the prescription she also mentioned the name of the medicines which need to be taken for the high blood pressure issues (which I came to know after I visited the pharmacy in the premises of Hiranandani hospital) for which my mother was already taking treatment from a cardiac specialist doctor. The doctor has made few changes in the medications which my mother was consuming for high blood pressure.\nSo I again went to doctor to ask about the medications she has suggested for the high blood pressure.\nWhen I reached her in her cabin on the 7th floor, she literally shouted at us and refused to attend my query for the high bp medicines which were prescribed by her (though it\u2019s not her speciality). She also mentioned that she has been suffering from high fever since last night and she will not attend any of my queries regarding the medications she has prescribed.\nI have few questions here as follows:\n1. If Dr. Geeta Malkan Billa was not physically (due to high fever as mentioned by her) or mentally fit then how did she do the gastroscopy procedure on my mother  and also attended OPD for others?\n2. If any patient has taken medicines not in a correct manner (because the patient has wrongly understood the medication course) and if anything goes wrong with the patient, then who will be responsible in such a case? Doctor who is treating a patient or L.H. Hiranandani Hospital?\nAfter that I lost trust on her and went to some other very senior doctor in Lilavati Hospital, he has clearly mentioned that as an Gasterology specialist no doctor can prescribe medicines for High Blood pressure and Diabetes. If any doctor is prescribed such then it\u2019s total money making business of doctor.\nBy having such rude and unprofessional doctors  Dr. L.H. Hiranandani Hospital are keeping the reputation at stake. The similar kind of experiences (behavioural issues) was faced by many patients in the recent past."

In our initial meeting she spent considerable time understanding my medical history rather than just jumping to giving her prescription. In my next consultation with her she explained to me the root cause of my repeated infections , something that had been blatantly ignored by the most prominent doctors in Mumbai. From then onwards began my journey of trust , resilience and cure with Dr.Billa. Over the last 11 years of my treatment with her I have found her to be an extremely kind, intelligent and compassionate individual who strives to help her patients in the best possible manner. Her in depth knowledge and intellect makes her one of the most exquisite doctors in the profession. Not only has my health improved but she has always been genuine in guiding me. In today\u2019s world where doctors are merely concerned with filling their pockets and disregarding the patient and their emotions ( something I have experienced) Dr.Billa is in the truest sense of the words a DOCTOR. An individual who does everything in her capacity to help her patients recover. I will forever be grateful to her."

Confronted with the complexity of the case, we consulted several neurosurgeons, only to be met with hesitation and concern over the risky and intricate nature of the required surgery. The lesion\u2019s precarious position necessitated a highly skilled approach, with each potential surgical route fraught with its own set of risks and complications.\n\nOur search for hope led us to Dr. Sudhir Dubey at Medanta Hospital. From our first meeting, his confidence and mastery in neurosurgery brought us the solace we so desperately needed. Despite the daunting prognosis, Dr. Dubey's assurance gave us the courage to proceed.\n\nThe surgery on 28th February 2024 was a pivotal moment in our lives. Dr. Dubey and his team, with their exceptional skill, successfully removed the tumor, confirmed to be a benign mature teratoma through biopsy. The precision and care with which they navigated the complex operation were nothing short of miraculous.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to Dr. Sudhir Dubey and his team for their lifesaving expertise, compassion, and unwavering dedication. Our son's recovery is a testament to their remarkable abilities and the grace that guided us to them. Words fall short of expressing our deep gratitude for the renewed hope and life they have given our son.\n\nDr. Dubey, you are not just a phenomenal surgeon but a beacon of hope for families like ours. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for giving our son a second chance at life. Our journey from despair to gratitude is a story of your exceptional care and our son\u2019s resilient spirit."

Many thanks to Dr. Surbhi Suden who had already made for me an appointment to meet Dr. Sudhir Dubey.\n\nNervous and unsure how to explain my struggles, I was immediately calmed by Dr. Dubey's quiet confidence and genuine attentiveness. I tend to be quite detailed, and he listened patiently to everything.\n\nWith a quick sketch, he illustrated his understanding of my spinal misalignment. Further tests confirmed surgery as the necessary path forward. Dr. Dubey explained the procedure in a clear and relatable way, easing my anxieties and building trust in the surgery he was about to perform on my spine. It was successfully done!\n\nJust two days after surgery, at my behest I was helped on my feet to take baby steps - which was a small but significant victory on my road to recovery. While healing continues, the pain I have now is manageable and sleepless nights are finally a thing of the past. If you're battling back problems, I highly recommend Dr. Dubey.

And then Dr Das came as a ray of light in our lives as he promised a quick healing through surgery and assured us discharge in 3-4 days only. Though sceptical and scared of surgery , we trusted him and he stood true to his words!\nNot only he did a fantastic job with the surgery but also provided us with endless moral support and personal care throughout the procedure.It all went so seamlessly. Dr Das is humble and caring for his patients apart from being a deft spine surgeon, which is a rare quality these days. We walked home happy and satisfied with our experience at ISIC , Delhi.

As I am typing this review  I am at the hospital waiting to see doctor. Time is 2pm and still there is no sign of us seeing him. I was told that there will be another two hours wait.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether it is  Due to high demand, or lack of time management with Doctors.\n\nwe need to wait for about 6 hours to consult with a doctor.\n\nThe doctors whom we consulted are very well behaved and try to resolve every problem with detail.\n\nThe nurses and staff are very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe infrastructure is upto date but needs some renovation at some of the sections.

When we said we would like to take opinion from other doctors as well, the hospital staff started acting rude. They started carrying out unnecessary tests. When I tried to enquire about the 2d echo, the doctor was not at all interested in explaining anything and told us to come and see him in his OPD for further consultation.\n\nThey denied us discharge as well. At the end I had to force them to let me sign a DAMA which they did not let me do. They purposely delayed the discharge saying that the tests reports are not ready yet. Even after waiting for 7 hours for discharge we were not handed the test reports.\n\nThe nurses are not at all trained.

Thank you so much madam for making our dream come true.\nNo other doctors would understand the issues in detail and be supported in any manner. We had undergone the advice of multiple doctors overseas, but of no use.\nAfter 8 years of marriage struggle for the kids, we are finally under guidance of the best doctor who could finally listen to our problem and provide support throughout my IVF treatment.\nThe way the doctor has shown confidence and transparency with our issues was really appreciated. Just like a family member (Elder Sister),she was always encouraged not to lose hope.\nNot only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.\nIt's rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.\nI never was made to wait. And if ever I needed to contact her or her staff, they were super speedy in responding to my inquiries.\nI really cannot express my gratitude in words and how heart touching every appointment we had with her.Thank you so much God for giving wonderful opportunity to meet Dr.Lakshmi Krishna Leela madam\nand under her guidance was able to conceive and in my First Trimester at the moment.\nThe Clinic is inviting and her beautiful staff members are friendly,caring and helpful in every way and well maintained infrastructure.\n\nI highly recommend becoming her patient!"

Very small room and disturbing. People sleeping on corridor,steps and landings. No one care. One duty sister and she is also with not much experience. First u need to pay 500 for consultation doctor will not prescribes any thing just he write admit. U need to pay 10000 advance and again 500 for registration. And general wards are horrible. If u want to discharge doctor words are sign and go we are not responsible. Very cheap mentality money making business. For OP consultation come if u have lots of time and money. If u don't have rooms and staff why u want to fill more patients. Just one request renovate ur hospital. Put proper staff."

I was playing a sport after a considerable amount of time and ended up twisting my knee leading to an ACL + meniscus tear on my right knee.\nIt\u2019s been 6 years from my surgery now, my knee feels as normal as before.\nDr. Gajjar took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, address any concerns I had, and ensure I was comfortable throughout the entire process. Their professionalism, knowledge, and skill instilled confidence in me from the start.\nThe surgery itself was a success, and I'm grateful for Dr. Gajjar\u2019s precise work. The recovery process has been smoother than I anticipated, thanks to the thorough instructions and follow-up care provided by Dr. Gajjar and their staff.\nNot only did they demonstrate outstanding surgical skill, but they also showed genuine care and empathy for my well-being. I felt supported every step of the way, which made a significant difference in my recovery journey.\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr. Gajjar to anyone in need of knee ACL surgery or orthopedic care. Their expertise, professionalism, and compassionate approach truly set them apart. Thank you, Dr. Gajjar, for helping me regain mobility and improving my quality of life."

Post the 3 month and feeling no relief I took a second opinion which, to my absolute shock, advised surgery due to ACL and LCL tear. After doing further diligence we found Dr Gajjar to whom we went for a 3rd opinion.\n\nHe too confirmed my worst fear that surgery was, indeed, imperative. His examination was precise and he exuded so much confidence, patience in explaining and listening/addressing my anxiety. I immediately knew that he would be the best at dealing with this multiple intervention know as the \"unhappy triad\" involving the ACL, LCL and Miniscus.\n\nThe surgery went ahead within a week of my visit in Feb 23 and the journey of recovery started thereafter under the watchful and concerned oversight by Dr Gajjar and his recommended team of physiotherapists.\n\nDr Gajjar, as he was on my first visit to him, came across truly as an absolute professional, very thorough in his skill and always keeping total healing as his primary goal. He was never satisfied with me just being fine, for him my achieving total flexibility and strength and nothing less was the singular and clarion objective.\n\nI cannot thank Dr Gajjar enough for not just being a great surgeon but an excellent human and for his dedication to the well being of those in his care."

Gajjar for the life-changing transformation it brought about. Before the surgery, my father was plagued by chronic knee pain, faced significant difficulties in walking and standing, and his quality of life had greatly deteriorated. However, after the surgery performed by Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, my father's life has taken a remarkable turn for the better.\n\nFrom the very first consultation with Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, we were impressed by his professionalism and expertise. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, its benefits, and any potential risks, ensuring that we felt well-informed and at ease with the decision to proceed. His compassionate and reassuring demeanor instilled confidence in our choice of surgeon.\n\nThe surgery itself was a resounding success. Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar and his surgical team demonstrated exceptional skill and precision, resulting in a seamless procedure. Post-surgery, my father's recovery was closely monitored by Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar and his dedicated medical staff, which greatly contributed to a smooth and efficient rehabilitation process.The results have been nothing short of astonishing.\n\nBefore the surgery, my father's knee pain made it nearly impossible for him to walk, run, or even bend his legs comfortably. But now, he is not only able to walk and stand without pain but has also regained the ability to run and bend his legs. The transformation in his mobility and overall quality of life has been truly remarkable.\n\nDr. Shreyash M. Gajjar goes above and beyond the call of duty. He takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being, providing detailed post-surgery care instructions and ensuring that any concerns are promptly addressed. His commitment to his patients' recovery is evident, and it has made all the difference in my father's journey to better health.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar highly enough for his exceptional skill, compassionate care, and dedication to his patients. His knee osteotomy surgery has truly been life-changing for my father, allowing him to regain his mobility, independence, and quality of life. If you or a loved one are facing similar knee issues, Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar is undoubtedly the surgeon you can trust for a successful and transformative outcome. We are eternally grateful for his expertise and care.\n\nThank you, Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, for giving my father a new lease on life."

N what I have learned is as follows:\n1) as mentioned above all shoulder pains r not frozen shoulder it can be muscle tear too which only a specialist can know n cure\n2) besides bones and joints there r muscles tendons rotator cuff and much more which can give u problems and pains\n3) each one has a separate specialist ortho to look after i. e. A general orthopedic for bones related issues and a sports orthopedic for muscles tendons etc etc which is DR SHREYASH GAJJAR.\n4) bones related issues r detected in Xrays n muscles related issues r detected in MRI so when ur pain is not detected in xrays please spend a little more n get a clear conclusion about ur issue and go to a specialist for that Particular problem instead of suppressing ur pain with pain killers n steroids\nUr muscle n tendons can be damaged or tear bcz they might b weak or bcz of exertion like heavy work or heavy exercise etc etc\nUr muscles can b weak by any reason and give u trouble\nIt can b bcoz of not proper nutrtion or age or other physical aliments hard work or heavy work etc etc\n\nJust b aware about ur issue and find a perfect specialist for ur particular issue\n\nThanks doctor gajjar and his teamfor everything"

I came to India from Bangladesh  in search of better treatment. So i saw a couple of well-known doctors here but with all honesty, the talk with Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar made me more confident and feel at ease. He told me to get an arthroscopic surgery after which my leg would be better than ever and I\u2019ll be able to play all sports comfortably again. He did my surgery and gave me instructions to follow for the next few months to heal and get my strength back. I\u2019d say i\u2019m almost there, just need to gain strength by doing exercises that he instructed. In my opinion, he is one of the most helpful and forthcoming doctors ever. He is truly one of the best at what he does. And it\u2019s not just him but his assistant Dr. Nilesh was of great help. Their service is unmatched.

I was looking for the Best Doctor & Best Hospital combination. Did all India extensive research & word of mouth survey. *AND I homed onto Dr Gagan Gautam, Uro Onco.* I met him in Medanta Medicity in Jun and found him to be a rare combination of best Head & Heart. I developed so much confidence in him that in just one meeting I said Yes for surgery and fixed up date for surgery.\nFinally I was operated on 15 Jul. A long surgery for 4 hours. Dr Gagan Gautam kept my wife informed all the time during surgery & reassuring her that all was well. After surgery he visited me two times a day, closely followed my recovery and kept my morale up. Not flattering or butteressing he is the Best Dr in India who is most compassionate, most accomodating , deeply involved in his patients, always reassuring, most professional and above all Always with a Smile which helped me to recover. After tryst with him I realized why ' Doctors are next to God'. He is a true Professional Leader and has developed a very dynamic team called 'Team Gagan'.\nIf you believe that Soldiers never Lie, then belive me that he is the 'Best in India'. And yes, I would also like to mention that Medanta Medicity is a State of the art World Class Hospital with top notch Faciliteis and  classic Administration & Management.\nKudos to Medanta, Kudos to Dr Naresh Trehan and above all SALUTE TO DR GAGAN GAUTAM."

It is my pleasure to review and express my admiration for the skill and professionalism of Dr. Subhash and his team.\nFrom the moment we arrived at the hospital, it was evident that my wife was in safe hands. The staff provided top notch care. Dr. Subhash and his team were impressive at demonstrating a high level of expertise and dedication to their work.\nDr. Subhash is a highly skilled surgeon with years of experience, who is not only a good doctor but also a superb human being. He was always amiable and approachable. His smiling face and selfless service made my wife feel at home. Dr. Subhash took the time to explain every step of the process to my wife and answered all the questions diligently. His explanation of the process of recovery and the surgery\u2019s after-effects gave us a lot of confidence. He was always patient, encouraging and catered to the surgery with utmost care and precision. We believe my wife\u2019s speedy recovery is remarkable only due to his prowess. Dr. Subhash and his team were professional, compassionate, and attentive throughout the surgery and after. It was evident that they are dedicated to providing the highest possible medical care to their patients.\nA special mention about the anaesthetist (sorry for forgetting the name) who provided my wife with outstanding care. His comprehensive understanding of my wife\u2019s medical history and his ability to tailor the anaesthesia specifically to her needs were praiseworthy. It was his empathetic approach and pain management plans that gave my wife comfort and overall benefited her well-being.\nI would also like to acknowledge the outstanding support of Mr. Rahul Chaudhury who was the department coordinator. I always found Mr. Rahul to be a highly professional individual who went above and beyond his duties to ensure seamless and efficient experience for the patients. His warmth and welcoming demeanour created a positive atmosphere in the waiting area. I am very grateful for the positive attitude he provided me with.\nThe team of physiotherapists consisting of Dr. Shashi, Dr. Priyanka, and Dr. Guntasha; provided my wife with exceptional care and support during her rehabilitation journey. Their knowledge, compassionate approach, individualized treatment plan, skillful therapy sessions and clear communication made a significant impact on my wife\u2019s recovery.\nTo conclude, Dr. Subhash and the team at Fortis Memorial Research Institute are an exceptional group of medical professionals who truly excel in their field. My wife\u2019s successful total knee replacement surgery is testament to their skill, expertise, and dedication. Thank you, Dr. Subhash and team, for providing us the best medical care we could have hoped for."

I am all praise for Dr. Hari when we finally consulted him. Not only did he, with his deep knowledge of the ailment and prognosis,  successfully treated my Mother\u2019s serious condition by  minimal oral medication, he continuously kept on encouraging her to beat all the odds and come out of a life threatening condition, which was totally unbelievable for the entire family!

My son met with an accident, he was given firstaid at Max and was advised to meet dr. Jaggi for a check up after 5 days. He straightway asked if I have insurance coverage. I said yes, he said the child needs to be operated. Dr. Jaggi didnt even ask to unwrap the soft plastering to see the hand condition etc. I was taken aback as the junior doctors in Max itself said that the injury was minor. We consulted another doctor at a different place and he also said that the child was recovering fast. No need for any surgery.\nDr. Jaggi to me is an example of an extreme money minded person with low integrity."

From the time I met Dr. Ajay, he instilled confidence in me by the way he went into the diagnosis before advising a CT scan. The results showed a stone in the salivary gland. He did not advise surgery immediately as most doctors would do, but he has put me on medication and will take a call only after 5 days.

We approached Medica Hospital, Kolkata, through our corporate hospital, TMH, Jamshedpur. My experience was extremely satisfying. Dr. Anil Singhi, who treated my son, explained the entire procedure in detail and admitted my son the same day and the intervention was done the very next day. We were later explained and shown the entire process. Dr. Singhi came as angel to treat my son\u2019s condition. It is now about 2 months since the intervention. He is absolutely normal now and going through life normally staying in a hostel in Bengaluru where he is studying. This was also confirmed in the follow up check-up which was done after 5 weeks. Very good care was taken while he was at the hospital and he was discharged in less than 48 hours. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the hospital and Dr. Singhi. I would like to assure all such patients and their parents that this is a very safe procedure and should be undergone if such a situation is detected.\nRegards,\nDeepak Kamath\nFather of the patient."

He is a renowned pediatric cardiologist who always takes the best care of his patients and gives the best possible advice. When we were desperately in need of advice regarding my condition (increased size of right ventricle due to absence of pulmonary valve as a result of TOF surgery on birth), we thought of seeking his expert opinion. He performed the necessary checkups and explained the whole situation patiently and in a way that even someone with no medical background would be able to understand. On his advice we flew to MMM Hospital in Chennai and I had the surgery done under expert care. The whole situation was handled professionally and smoothly and a large part of that was due to Dr. Anil Singhi."

On our first visit Dr Singhi assured us that it can be closed by device closure procedure and she will get discharged on the very next day from hospital. On his assurance we went for the procedure and the whole thing was same as he described. She got discharged from the hospital on the very next day of the procedure. Within 2 days my wife started doing her regular normal work without any restrictions as suggested by Dr Singhi. Now after 6 months Eco cadio shows the wholeis completely closed and she has required no further medications nothing. Thank you Doctor ."

He will prescribe you wrong and heavy dose medicines which will deteriorate your health and you have to get admitted to hospital. This is his policy to get money from his patients. I had visited him for my grandfather who had heart related issues, my grandfather has sugar and bp problems as well, he asked him about his pre existing illness like bp, sugar and knowingly prescribed him very heavy dose for sugar and bp along with heart medicines. My dadaji took those medicines for 2 days and at 2 nd night, his sugar got down to 36 and bp lowered to 45/80. I took him to hospital and doctor admitted him to icu, i told them all the medicines prescribed by dr.amit pendhakar-- trust me doctor was shocked and he told me because of these medicines only my dadaji bp and sugar fluctuated to this level..he immediately stopped these medicines and then i went to aakash hospital confronting dr. Amit pendhakar on this, there i come to know we are not the only victim of his money making tricks, but there were so many patients complaining about the same issue. Thankfully i took my dadaji to another hospital to an another doctor.\nGuys please don't go to dr.amit pendhakar ever, he is just a money making doctor with no ethical values, no humanity- he is not a doctor but a businessman who is making money on people life's."

I knew Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in coincidence; it was after I told that my daughter could not get medical treatment in domestic medication for her sickness of heart and shall go to foreign country to be treated. A person knows our problem has recommended me that there is a good doctor named Suresh Rao who is working in Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and can help my daughter and also he gave us the address of the doctor to search and know about him. I decided to take my daughter to there and let her get the medical treatment after I observed the knowledge and experience of the doctor. Then we send them the medical documents of my daughter and they answered me that they are happy to help her. I went to India Mumbai by agreeing on the medical cost they stated. Dr. Suresh Rao was seen my daughter on the 3rd day she enrolled to the Hospital, my daughter has a problem of Mitral valve get narrowed and the only solution told to me from the domestic doctor is to make replacement of the valve with artificial valve. But there fraud action started here, they told me that the medication for her age in this Hospital is widening the valve as much as possible and they are not going to replace the valve. I have had a chance to choose the other hospital if they were told me this idea when I was in my country. Later on, I understood that the woman named Nidhi Patel who is in Assistant international marketing department was answering to our Email by the name of the Dr. Suresh Rao himself when I was there in my country. But I had no option and I agreed with idea as I assume the medical treatment is for sure better than the domestic medical treatment and my daughter was operated at her age of two years and seven months and also she recovered after some days. Then I was happy and the Dr. Told me that my daughters good and I can go back to my country, but my daughter starts manifesting the symptoms she has before the surgery right after a couple of days the Dr. Told me she is well. But my daughter begins to go to ICU for she has no change. She was taking a kind of medicine taken through mouth while the symptom manifestation is there, they changed the medicine to injector and the symptom hide for a time being and manifest after some days. I never expect this from the Dr. Said to have much more experience. I started scare, my daughter continue going to ICU without any additional help, and the Dr. was very careless toward her. One day I told that my daughter has discharged from the Hospital without any recovery by signature of the Dr. Never seen her, I never get anybody to hear me even though I tell she is not recovered from the sickness. I was alone going out of my country and I never assume this incidence will in country, then I got out of there by having  my daughter for  I cannot go any were without my daughter. These all actions were to let me pay more money. She discharged on September 29/2017 and readmit on October 1/2017 for the sickness aggravate, whoever but she never get unique help other than getting the medicine into her body through injector. I took my daughter to foreign country for better medical treatment but she started to suffer even more. She stayed in Hospital for long time by going to I CU for more than 35 days in Hospital in the same condition. I told that she need another surgery after the doctor used to follow up her in domestic hospital has talked to Dr. Suresh Rao in telephone call and convinced him for she had no change. My daughter never need the second surgery if the doctor was use his knowledge and experience on the first surgery. They requested me additional money by their fault and I shocked. I never expect that they cruelly snatch this much by the name medical treatment especially to the cost of child\u2019s life even though I knew some Indians fraud. I was very worry because the cost was beyond the plan and they told me it is not possible even though I asked them to minimize the cost."

The hygene standard they maintain is awesome. Sometimes I wonder how reasonable they are  giving their goods and services to the customers where other institutions in the same profession is looting people.\nComing to Staffs,they are very caring,generous and have a human touch, specially Mr Ishwar, Zahir and all of them whose names I don't know.\nI am sure Mr Bain and team would go a very long way because of their ethics and honesty that they shower on everyone that visits.

Not only is Dr. Santosh an excellent surgeon, he is also very good at connecting with his patients and their relatives.

The successful robotic surgery of my renal cancerous tumor is proof of it. And the best thing was the way Dr. Santosh and other doctors, specifically Dr. Vibushit encouraged me to fight with the post surgery discomforts. That helped me a lot to have a quick recovery. I am really grateful.\n\nIt would be unfair if I don't mention one thing. I believe you expect an honest opinion from me. My experiences with most of the nursing staff who were on duty during my admission period were not good. I would say they are not properly trained. Some of them looked like they were reluctant to serve the patients. The patients have to take care on their own whether the fluid/injection is actually passing or not, if it is already finished! Would be good if the doctors can take care of these things and ensure nursing for the patients.\n\nIn the end, thank you Dr. Santosh, very much for helping me to get rid of the worst situation of my life."

I don't know why he force everybody for fibroscan. He just gave himself every award and always bragging about his thesis about stages of liver cancer in Argentina. Selling generic medicine on very high cost. I will never visit him and advice anyone to go. This is my opinion totally."
