fantastic and caring team of professionals that ensure patient is well taken care of It is good to  have a competent surgeon who is a straight talker He did my mothers knee replacement surgeries and she is walking without support within 3 weeks and recovering strongly every day Will strongly recommend\n\nMy patient was admitted under him for a simple knee fracture in Fortis but only because of his and his teams negligence my patient is in ventilation Post operation there were few complications which we had flagged many times but they never paid attention How can such renowned doctor in a hospital like Fortis be this much casual Those minute complications has caused my patient septic shock and she is now in death bed They are not doctors they are just here to do business I request everyone to not admit your patient under this worthless irresponsible doctor We have already raised the situation in concerned platforms but we all know we can never win the fight against these doctors who hold such powers He does not even deserve a single star Worthless and irresponsible\n\nHe is one of the best doctos I have come across Recently one month back my father who is 71years old had both of his knees replaced by Dr Ronen Roy Within just one month he is able to walk again like a 40years old man My family is really grateful to find such a doctor who is a very straight forward person yet polite and humble He is God to us because my father who was in extreme pain and could not walk properly is smiling again today Thank you Sir\n\nLast month Dr Roy carried out the knee replacement surgery on both the knees of my wife  She is doing fine now and is walking without support inside and outside the house  We are  extremely satisfied with Dr Roy and his treatment Shall not hesitate to recommend him to our friends and relatives\n\nI got the reference of Dr Ronen Roy from one of my close friend Once I visited with my mother who is suffering from osteoporosis I met with other patients who also appreciated very much about the doctor Ronen sir checked my mother suggested some tests and after seeing the test results he suggested for TKR Total Knee Replacement for both knees Operation was done successfully on 28th Feb 2023 and 4th March 2023 Physiotherapists under Ronen Sir guidance helped my mother to start walking from next day of the surgery After 8 days my mother was discharged and physiotherapy started in home I would recommend Dr Ronen Roy to everybody as I did not hear any wrong feedback from the surgeries he had done Dr Ronen Roy is heading the orthopedic department of Fortis I would suggest please make prior appointments and be on time\n\nIt is my pleasure to express gratitude before Dr Roy as my wife had gradually recovered and started to walk without assitance after undergoing Knee Surgery in both the legs  just 5 weeks back\nCongratulations to DrRoy and his team Shall also recommend to othersAloke Dasgupta\n\nMy mother was suffering from knee issue for last 15 years After taking Dr Ronen Roys advice and treatment she is now able to walk after 15 years I behalf of my mother is very much thankful to him\n\nToday we had Dr Ronen Roys appointment we were late by 30 mins but we were in contact with the reception that we are stuck in traffic but we would be reaching in few minutes while reaching there Dr Ronen Roy was seeing a patient and he told the receptionist that he will not see any other patient We requested him a lot to check my mother but he didnt paid any heed to our request My mother is an arthritis and systematic sclerosis patient with so much pain she somehow managed to reach the dr but he did not even show any pity Is this the behaviour of an educated doctor His attitude was more important for him than his patient Such a unprofessional behaviour is not expected from such a senior  Dr like him He must be a great Dr by knowledge but by behaviour and heart he is not even a good human\n\nHe did the knee replacement 5byears back\nBut recently his behavior and patient care goes down drastically\nFees at fortis is sky high 1320 but he would not even listen to you\nFor a diagnostic report if you miss to take the printout of one page he would not take a sneak pick even if it at your mobile Not even will listen to you\nFelt like being cheated after paying hefty fees\nAnother issue at fortis now a days even they give you appointment they will ask everyone to report one time and then take the turn on the first come first serve basis This created a crowd and of course not social distancing\nNow I can safely recommend others noto visit Dr Ronen Roy He is not the same doctor anymore like he used to be 6 years back\n\nMy experience was very bad few years backjust found him onlinewent with a complicated case of my wife completely backed out on listening to the problemwhat kind of doctor is scared on hearing a complicated problem  isnt it something they should yearn for didnt even have the courtesy of returning the fees\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "res\\7aab2e67-8748-4ec9-91db-8bda2a202934.txt"}}}
