much doctor  team \n\nI am Mrs Tenni I am Ethiopian I was not remembering my victim and suffer if my daughter would alive I knew Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in coincidence it was after I told that my daughter could not get medical treatment in domestic medication for her sickness of heart and shall go to foreign country to be treated A person knows our problem has recommended me that there is a good doctor named Suresh Rao who is working in Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and can help my daughter and also he gave us the address of the doctor to search and know about him I decided to take my daughter to there and let her get the medical treatment after I observed the knowledge and experience of the doctor Then we send them the medical documents of my daughter and they answered me that they are happy to help her I went to India Mumbai by agreeing on the medical cost they stated Dr Suresh Rao was seen my daughter on the 3rd day she enrolled to the Hospital my daughter has a problem of Mitral valve get narrowed and the only solution told to me from the domestic doctor is to make replacement of the valve with artificial valve But there fraud action started here they told me that the medication for her age in this Hospital is widening the valve as much as possible and they are not going to replace the valve I have had a chance to choose the other hospital if they were told me this idea when I was in my country Later on I understood that the woman named Nidhi Patel who is in Assistant international marketing department was answering to our Email by the name of the Dr Suresh Rao himself when I was there in my country But I had no option and I agreed with idea as I assume the medical treatment is for sure better than the domestic medical treatment and my daughter was operated at her age of two years and seven months and also she recovered after some days Then I was happy and the Dr Told me that my daughters good and I can go back to my country but my daughter starts manifesting the symptoms she has before the surgery right after a couple of days the Dr Told me she is well But my daughter begins to go to ICU for she has no change She was taking a kind of medicine taken through mouth while the symptom manifestation is there they changed the medicine to injector and the symptom hide for a time being and manifest after some days I never expect this from the Dr Said to have much more experience I started scare my daughter continue going to ICU without any additional help and the Dr was very careless toward her One day I told that my daughter has discharged from the Hospital without any recovery by signature of the Dr Never seen her I never get anybody to hear me even though I tell she is not recovered from the sickness I was alone going out of my country and I never assume this incidence will in country then I got out of there by having  my daughter for  I cannot go any were without my daughter These all actions were to let me pay more money She discharged on September 292017 and readmit on October 12017 for the sickness aggravate whoever but she never get unique help other than getting the medicine into her body through injector I took my daughter to foreign country for better medical treatment but she started to suffer even more She stayed in Hospital for long time by going to I CU for more than 35 days in Hospital in the same condition I told that she need another surgery after the doctor used to follow up her in domestic hospital has talked to Dr Suresh Rao in telephone call and convinced him for she had no change My daughter never need the second surgery if the doctor was use his knowledge and experience on the first surgery They requested me additional money by their fault and I shocked I never expect that they cruelly snatch this much by the name medical treatment especially to the cost of childs life even though I knew some Indians fraud I was very worry because the cost was beyond the plan and they told me it is not possible even though I asked them to minimize the cost\n\nHe is God to me He performed a lober surgery on my 3 mths old son and by the grace of god and DR SURESH RAO he is in the best of health till today at the age of 9\ni might not have got a chance to thank him after the follow up but i always thank him in my prayers Thnk u sir to u and ur team efforts \n\nDr Rao n his team are superb Highly experienced n talented God bless them\n\nHi sir My Nephew MdAli Mithani he is ur patient n now he is perfectly alright Thanku so much sir \n\n", "metadata": {"source":
