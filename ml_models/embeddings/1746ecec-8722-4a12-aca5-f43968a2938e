and he  cleared my all doubts and I got admitted smoothly Hospital Care Buddy Mr Abhishek was always available on call or to meet whenever you need anything\n\nThirdly the Hospital and Nurse Department were also good caring and making all process smoothly  but remember if you are going through Pristyn Care then dont make more expectations from Hospital side  if you need anything then just

doctor is super egoistic no professionalism whatsoever Theres no system at the client He attends to a minimum of 3 patients at the same time which is not ETHICAL\nSecond HE DOES NOT RESPECT HIS PATIENTS\nThird he thinks he is the God of Sports Medicine\n\nWe get that he has grown on social media because of his content but that content does not align with his personality He literally disrespected an army man by saying that you dont have enough funds to get an operation done by me\n\nThe staff is also very very arrogant  egoistic\n\nI would highly recommend please do not visit here if youve known him from social media\nWe fell in the trap I am saving you a lot of trouble\n\nDr Bora treated my mother and mother in law for knee and shoulder pain respectivelyBoth were advised surgery by other hospitals but with Dr Boras treatment both are doing good without surgery One of the best things about Dr Bora is he genuinely cares about his patients and advises what is best for them\n\nBest doctor with best backend team for billing and rest of the supports like TPA n all for this Thanks Vipin Ji\nDr Manu Sir r an expert in this field Thanks for giving me a new start sir\nThanks for physio team also especially Dr Mansi\n\nFirst of all I would like to salute Dr Manu Bora\nBecause his working schedule is very good\nAnd the patient or any local or candidate from any state is the best way to talk to them\nAnd meeting the head gave me a lot of peace\nThank you sir and all members\n\nI had my right knee Grade 3 ACL  Medial meniscus tear I stay in Mumbai and consulted many orthopaedic doctors but wasnt satisfied with consulting at last after research of many YouTube videosGoogle reviews I met Dr Manu Bora and finally decided to undergo surgery from him and done with my operation  Dr Manu Bora explained me very well in detail about the operation  I received a great support from DrManu Bora Team specially speaking about Mr Sujeet He guided me since consulting to complete operation procedure and was continuously in follow up post surgery also he supported me very well in mediclaim As of now I am on rest period due to No knee bending for some time due to meniscus surgery Will share my further feedback about the operation treatment and result soon\n\nThank You Dr Manu Bora  Team\n\nThis was my worst experience so far while visiting a doctor I was the second patient to arrive and I got a chance to see the doctor after 25 hours as patients were called randomly and when I went to see the doctor he did not physically examine my shoulder and neck as I was experiencing severe pain or listen to my problem\n\nI highly recommend Dr Manu Bora for their exceptional medical expertise and caring demeanor From my first appointment it was evident that Mr Sujeet genuinely cares about their patients and goes above and beyond to provide comprehensive care\nHe took the time to listen attentively to my concerns thoroughly explain diagnoses and treatment options and answer any questions I had in a way that was easy to understand\n\nOverall he helped in each and every manner during the course of my surgery\n\n", "metadata": {"source":
