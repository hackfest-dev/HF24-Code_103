for my BrotherSani Umar at Max Hospital on December 26 2023 and the next day he was able to start walking using a walker and today he is able to walk normally using only a stick We are highly delighted with this excellent and exceptional Doctor for his Passion and commitment towards our treatment\n\nI trusted Dr Jaggi to carry out a left clavicle surgery He told me that he would implant a plate with 9 screws go for a graft if necessary and join the 2 fractures It was a failure I am in intense pain now I visited him several times and he said I will take out the plate and insert a new plate How can I trust him  he had me under full anesthesia and had all the freedom to solve my fracture He did not I am sorry to be blunt but my experience has been poor with Dr Jaggi\n\nI had a very bad experience with Dr Jaggi I took my 8 year old son to Max Gurgaon to this doctor with a hairline fracture in his arm My son met with an accident he was given firstaid at Max and was advised to meet dr Jaggi for a check up after 5 days He straightway asked if I have insurance coverage I said yes he said the child needs to be operated Dr Jaggi didnt even ask to unwrap the soft plastering to see the hand condition etc I was taken aback as the junior doctors in Max itself said that the injury was minor We consulted another doctor at a different place and he also said that the child was recovering fast No need for any surgery\nDr Jaggi to me is an example of an extreme money minded person with low integrity\n\nI am Deepika  I really thanks to Dr Jaggi to suggest me what happen to me at right time  With the suggestion of dr I got my ACL surgery done and getting recovered\n\nIt was just a small hit on the bench and I would have never been aware about this is dr Jaggi has not suggest to do MRI first  In MRI report I got to know that my left knee ACL tear occurs then dr Jaggi suggested to get operation done as soon as possible  otherwise as per my age it will affect my knee \n\nI Thank to Dr Jaggi  Specifically Dr Karan Prashant  and Max team for fruitful suggestions and support \n\nDeepika \nYour happiest patient\n\nOne of the best doctors I have met I got my 7 year old sons ORIF done because of his elbow fracture from him and needless to say he is amazing Not only is he professionally the best but also very caring and humble towards the patients explaining them every minute details Am sure anyone who meets him will get great positive vibes from him\n\nVery bad doctor Had very horrible experience He doesnt took good care of my daughters fracture case Behaviour is not good\n\nI went to dr jbs jaggi for an ankel twist injury he advised me surgery now after 25 months later still no sign of improvement\n\nWhen i went for a 2nd opinion to another dr he performed some tests and told me that there was no need for a surgery and why  the dr jbs Jaggi did it i dont know and found atfl still positive to my leg\n\nSo in short he is not a good doctor do not waste your time going to this dr at all he is just trying to make fools of their patients i have of the victim so trying to be aware of others\n\nI contacted Dr Jaggi for treatment of my mother who had to undergo spinal fracture treatment last year Under Dr Jaggis supervision operation was successful and now my mother is again back to normal routine He is a thorough professional and is having very friendly behaviour He knows his job well and takes good care of his patients I thank him for all the help and care during my mothers treatment\n\nThe services that we received from Max Healthcare is excellent I was admitted last year and my family felt the service was excellent\n\nSo we availed their services for my mom who was suffering from arthritis Was referred over by Dr Vikas and we can see why\n\nDr Jaggi and the staff are friendly and ensured that we were properly informed about health and care Dr Jaggi is incredible and more a friend than a Doctor He explained everything to us in a very clear manner and specific Appreciate him for taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options The surgery went smoothly And of course postoperative care followed suit From his excellent treatment curiosity investigative mind and ability to connect you know where you stand immediately and what next steps look like\n\nAll the staff were great  they were helpful patient and ensured my mom had a smooth prep surgery and followup\n\nI would have no qualms in recommending Dr Jaggi\n\nHis coordinator Mr Prashant was very helpful as well  right from scheduling the appointment dos  donts and any other info you will expect in a surgery scheduled in hospital\n\nDr Jaggi gives honest opinion about the problem He explained to me in detail about the disease and its cure\nHe has the personal touch which is very important for a patient undergoing surgery\nHis post operative advise is very good\nOverall a great and comfortable experience with Dr Jaggi and his team\nHeartfelt gratitude to him\n\n", "metadata": {"source": "res\\b4e193f5-21d7-4605-93dd-767a693dc599.txt"}}}
