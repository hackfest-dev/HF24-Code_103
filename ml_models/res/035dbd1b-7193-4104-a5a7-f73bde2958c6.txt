My experience with Dr Sabhyata Gupta was deeply troubling Her prescription of seemingly unnecessary tests driven by a quest for commissions raised serious ethical concerns It appeared that financial gain took precedence over the wellbeing of patients and this practice felt exploitative and detrimental to healthcare trust Dr Guptas apparent greed and willingness to compromise patient care for monetary interests left me with a sense of profound disappointment and a lack of confidence in her commitment to ethical medical practices

Highly thankful to Dr Sabhyata Gupta and her excellent team The magical hands of doctor have made a hope of life for my wife Bharti who has been recently operated by her She is next to God for me very trusted expertise polite and caring to her patients Moreover the coordinating team and support staff of the doctor is very cooperative and professional
She is definitely best doctor in the field
Highly recommend with once again with handful of thanks

Dr Sabhyata Gupta is a skilled knowledgeable doctor I really had a great experience she handled my case so smoothly I am completely satisfied  with her treatment

I came from Dhaka Bangladesh to MEDANTA Gurgaon without any preappointment Dr Kanchan  Kaur reffered me to DrSabhyata Gupta She fit me in her extremely tight schedule on next morning She listened to my case peaceful in details checked all medical files carefully  explain my treatments options Also suggested best viable So its became easier for me to take decisions She is a great doctor and I am under her treatment and guidance I got my surgery done through her and on my second day I became very comfortable  In day Three I walked all by myself And on Day 4 I realised from hospital  walked home without any pain  support Her team is very empathetic  effective too The entire experience is so blessed  seemless I am Glad I got chance to get treated her And I am on my path to recovery I will refer my network to her inshallah

I am not sure who are these people who had rated DrSabhyata Gupta with a 12 3 star ratings She is a great doctor and I am under her treatment and guidance Just got hysterectomy done through her and today on my second day I am very comfortable  The entire experience is so seemless I am Glad that I selected her And I am on my path to recovery

Bogus Doctor Even before looking at patient she is asking the income of the family She refused to admit the patient as we were in CGHS I lost my mother because of her moneymindedness Please do not do the same mistake or you will regret like us
