Excellent experience with the Dr 
We have been going to Dr Singhania for a family member who has lung cancer
Dr is very detailed and goes through all the reports thoroughly before recommending any treatment
He is very patient in explaining things and very knowledgeable
My family has been to him twice and we have had a very good experience

Dr Singhania is the best clinician  and very empathetic human being He coordinated my grandmothers care couple years ago and was  quick to respond when my other family needed care An invaluable asset to Kokilaben

Dr Vishal is a very good and experienced doctor He has performed a very complex spine surgery in our case Also his post operative care and concern has been really great He is a gem of a human being very humble

Dr Sumit is one of the best pulmonologists in the city I have known him for many years I consulted him for my aunt who has lung fibrosis We were very happy with the treatment and the care he took of her I highly recommend him for anyone who needs a lung specialist

Dr Sumeet is a pulmonologist par excellence and above that He is very humble and humane in his approach to his patients
Have been consulting him for my uncle who is a case of complicated Asthma for the last 56 hours
Highly recommended him for any lung related disease

 Dr Singhania was the default pulomologist appointed by Kokilaben when a relative was admitted for COVID We also took online consult for another asymptomatic COVID positive relative
 Our experience has been brilliant Besides being extremely knowledgeable and up to date with the disease he always gave us a very patient hearing for every little or major problemquestion we had He also was well informed about the case at all points
 No unnecessary and irrational investigations
 Due to his treatment both are now doing fine
 We have now shifted to him for the patients chronic asthma management as well which too is going very well

Strongly recommended for all your pulmonary issues
