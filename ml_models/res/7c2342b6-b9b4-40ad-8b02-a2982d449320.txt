It might looks over hype on my review
But its true story  I was suffering from clotting in my left leg and its been for almost 7 years in which every month I need to go for angiography but after meeting Santesh sir things got change I need to take angiography for 6 months after which it got almost recured and for little pain which left behind for that Shantesh sir motivation was enough to handle for ahead in life
Thanks sir you have added much in my life

I would definitely recommend Dr shantesh as my father got operated under him He went through 2 major ie By pass surgery and valve replacementoperations at the same time His recovery was speedy and he is now absolutely fine with regular follow ups

Dr Shantesh Kaushik is undoubtedly one of the best cardiac surgeons in Mumbai My father was operated by him 4 yrs ago It was a very critical case and even had a preoperative complication which was managed by him very well Very humble and down to earth person his presence itself is reassuring Thank you very much Dr

Dr Kaushik is a very straightforward and honest doctor who discusses the patient case very clearly and counsels the family well at the same time His helpful nature has not only helped us  But many in un named patients His clinic is simplistic but he navigates  even the most difficult cases by his expertise and experience

My dad got operated by drkaushikhe really saved my fathers life We are grateful that my dad got operated by him You can trust him blindly Very humble and down to earth to speak

An excellent surgeonclearly explains rhe condition Very empathetic with his patients and he is very calm and approachable

Excellent Doctor very calm person who will remember your history after 5 yrs also Explains the things nicely and always guide patients to correct directionHe is a  a life saver to many peoples

Excellent doctor and humble person My father got heart treatment under him He explain issues nicely and provide full support

Mere dad ka operation in hone kiya thaor bahot ache Se yeh samjhate haibahot ache hai
