Very good treatment we experienced  

Excellent and commited doctorsrainbow childrens hospitalBanjara hills
Well mannered and highly professional doctors team under the guidance of most respectable doctor DrK Nageshwar Rao garu are making the little lifes to smile and giving them bright future

I personally thank all the doctors team Rainbow childrens hospital Banjara hills for collective efforts and giving hope to kids

My niece who is 28 years old had a heart problem from birth He has VSD with Pulmonary Artesia Mr Koneti explained the problem and suggested for a surgery He explained the things well and was patient to answer the questions Others major doctors like Chinaswamy reddy who was the actual surgeon was also good They had taken care of the operation very well

Few bad things
Staff is not friendly and are some times arrogant
Takes too long to process documents or getting an appointment Has to wait for hours with no apparent reason
No parking very disappointing

Excellent treatment for the childrens so much thank you for the doctors and the staff thank you special thanks to the Dr Nageshwar Rao koneti sirs explanation was so good
