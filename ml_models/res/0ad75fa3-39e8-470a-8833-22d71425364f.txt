Dr Hemant Kalyan treated me so generously and explained my knee problem  very well His treatment made me  walk on my own legs without support now  He is so sincere  dedicated towards his service 

FRAUD alert 

He made me go for his wax and other hot therapies for ankle pain for 1 MONTH Just because he has equipments and staff he will make you go for therapies that are not required

My friend suggested   just roll ankle frozen bottle on the floor THATs IT It worked and I was without lain in 23 days

I felt very bad about drafter so much experiencehe didnt fix ligament issue

My mom is still suffering from her bone spur performed in 2007 by this doc she still cries

Liked the detailed explanation and examination procedure
