I first met Dr Satish Rao and his father in year 2002 for treatment and was astonished by his caring and warm gesture and state of art treatment
I recently met him again I went for my sisters treatment and my experience was nothing short of exceptional From the moment we stepped into his office we felt at ease thanks to his genuine concern for his patients wellbeing
What truly sets Dr Rao apart is his dedication to personalized care His explanations were clear and easy to understand and he made sure that we were comfortable with the treatment plan every step of the way
Throughout my interactions with Dr Rao I was impressed by his professionalism and attention to detail
Moreover Dr Raos compassion and empathy are truly remarkable He supported me and my sister throughout her treatment and also looked after my sisters emotional wellbeing
I cannot recommend Dr Satish Rao highly enough His combination of expertise personalized care professionalism and compassion makes him a standout surgeon in his field
