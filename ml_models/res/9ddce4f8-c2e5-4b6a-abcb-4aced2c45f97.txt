Dr Vivek Nangia is not only an Excellent Doctor he is also a superb Human being a Great Social Worker friendly approach with a smiling face He is a SAVIOR to me and many others 
Its rare to find a doctor that combines such outstanding quality of medical care excellent treatment curiosity investigative mind and ability to connect  most important his positivity you know where you stand immediately and what next steps to go ahead with

Dr Nangai is an outstanding doctor Hes very understanding and listens to your concerns We recommended him to one of our relatives who was severely suffering from a lungs disorder However he provided an amazing diagnosis for the condition that has helped in improving the overall health We all thank him for his assistance and support

Dr Vivek Nangia is an exceptional human being and an outstanding doctor I had the privilege of visiting him with my friend who was experiencing PostCovid complications Prior to seeing Dr Nangia my friend had consulted several other pulmonologists without finding any relief However after seeking Dr Nangias advice and following his prescribed medication my friends health began to improve significantly It was truly an awesome experience

I would also like to mention the excellent teamwho provided immense support throughout the entire duration of the admission Even during the night when my friend experienced issues such as headaches and gas they went above and beyond by personally visiting our room promptly contacted Dr Nangia to discuss medications and instructed the nursing staff accordingly This level of personal attention not only provided relief but also instilled confidence in the patient leading to a faster recovery

Overall I am immensely grateful to Dr Vivek Nangia and his exceptional team for their expertise care and dedication to their patients wellbeing

dr nangia is great doctor my mother was admitted under him and I must say that he gave her the best treatment available I noticed during his icu rounds that he puts his heart and soul for every patient admitted under him he is a doctor with great knowledge and remarkable expertise in critical care management

I was having severe sinus issues and i had visited so many ent doctors but no one could evaluate the right diagnosis it was dr nangia who asked me do a simple test and after that he gave me the right treatment and I must say he is not only a great doctor but a great human being too Now i am perfectly alright

My mother got treated by him almost 78 years back for severe Tuberculosis He is not only an expert in his subject at the hospital but also an amazing human being Modest and humble he used to guide us over phone for little things that could be helped with a tablet or two as we stayed far away from Delhi He never made us feel that he was at such a high position that we cant contact him without prior appointment
I can never forget how sick my mother was before meeting him and the way he used to guide us

Last month on 22 feb i went to a pulmonlogist name dr vivek nangia in max hospital sakethe ia the biggest fraud doctor of delhi I recommended all my friends and colleagues to not go to this doctor His assistants are big forged and only aim to assist to loot the patients rather than help patients I spents lacs but even the whole of the test doctor even didnt diagnose simple ILD which are confirmed by all pulmonologist
His assistant are not even bother to recieve patients call
i again recommend not go to DR VIVEK NANGIA at Max saket

Very poor experience seeing him Took my father who suffered with a pneumothorax He was busy on his mobile phone and not even keen to listen Got my dad admitted and frankly speaking his junior team helped and sorted things out for us Talks more like a politician than a doctor Poor bedside manners and definitely incompetent as a pulmonologist Sadly his ward rounds were a joke I am a physician myself and couldnt believe how he would conduct himself Best avoided

Big looter knows nothing his rounds are even a joke he is doing nothing in his ward rounds only begging bed to bed for 1800rs his OPD is a romantic place for him with his so called coordinator believe me or not he has no proper diagnosis and nothing at all Dont risk ur life never go for him

I even doubt the degree of Mr Vivek Nangia he is only looting people and nothing else my mother was admited under him for at least 2 months at max saket his team couldnt even place the chest tube properly and he kept watching and doing X rays without even manipulating the tube my mother was admited for pneumothorax and got discharged with much more problems like DVT and Pulmonary Embolism all because of their malpractice I cannot suggest anyone to go for him remember my mother was having pneumothorax only and she spend 2 months in the hospital and being a full cash patient we spend 24 lakhs  still they couldnt resolve it
