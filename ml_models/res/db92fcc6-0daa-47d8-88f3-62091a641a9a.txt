One of the best Doctor and the bestest Human being I have met Very caring women call it a motherly care Her experience is abundant and gives the best care and prescribe the best medication affordable to all class I have been consulting her since 2020 for my gastrointestinal issues have been undergone few endoscopic conducted by her Very supportive always gives the hope and I have recovered well under her guidance

One of the best Doctor I recently had an excellent experience with Dr Geeta Billa at L H Hiranandani hospital Powai Dr Geeta was incredibly knowledgeable taking the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly explain the procedures and treatment options The whole process from diagnosis to followup was seamless I highly recommend Dr Geeta for anyone in need of a skilled and caring gastroenterologist

Doctor Billa is an expert and takes time to explain the logic of treatment to be undertaken Quite a meticulous doctor and conducts very good analysis and treats patients accordingly so that they get cured

Please dont go if u wish you have to stay healthy physically and mentallyWorst doctor ever seen she didnt have the basic manners to talk with people First she has to be good human being she dont know basic manners dont know how to deal with patients concerns A fake doctor with lots of degrees Perfect money eater

One of the best gastroenterology doctors I have ever encountered I have sought medical assistance from numerous physicians around the globe for my gastroenterology issues but after consulting with Dr Gita Billa I am overjoyed and completely satisfied with the exceptional level of care I received Dr Billas approach to my case was truly remarkable  she displayed an incredible attention to detail in her responses and diagnosis Her reports were thorough and comprehensive reflecting her commitment to providing the best possible care Furthermore her understanding and empathy towards my concerns were truly commendable I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically recommend Dr Gita Billa to anyone seeking a highly skilled and compassionate gastroenterologist She is undoubtedly a gem in her field

Doctor treated my father Mr Napoleon Silvera almost 11 years back in Feb 2012 My father was severely ill when he started treatment under Dr Geeta and we got best advice regarding his condition and palliative care She strives to help her patients in the best possible manner I found her to be extremely delligent and intelligent in her diagnosis We shifted treatment from Kokilaben Ambani hospital to Hiranandani at Powai only because we wished to continue under her supervision and doctor had shifted there  Thank you doctor for caring for my father in his crisis

We have got very very bad experiences With Dr Geeta Malkan Billa I hope this will help others not to go for any treatments to such doctors who are are hungry for money We visited Dr Geeta Malkan Billa after the scheduled Gastroscopy for my mother followed by OPD
We discussed the findings in the reports she has suggested and also she has prescribed the medicines for diabetic and gastrology problems to my mother
In the prescription she also mentioned the name of the medicines which need to be taken for the high blood pressure issues which I came to know after I visited the pharmacy in the premises of Hiranandani hospital for which my mother was already taking treatment from a cardiac specialist doctor The doctor has made few changes in the medications which my mother was consuming for high blood pressure
So I again went to doctor to ask about the medications she has suggested for the high blood pressure
When I reached her in her cabin on the 7th floor she literally shouted at us and refused to attend my query for the high bp medicines which were prescribed by her though its not her speciality She also mentioned that she has been suffering from high fever since last night and she will not attend any of my queries regarding the medications she has prescribed
I have few questions here as follows
1 If Dr Geeta Malkan Billa was not physically due to high fever as mentioned by her or mentally fit then how did she do the gastroscopy procedure on my mother  and also attended OPD for others
2 If any patient has taken medicines not in a correct manner because the patient has wrongly understood the medication course and if anything goes wrong with the patient then who will be responsible in such a case Doctor who is treating a patient or LH Hiranandani Hospital
After that I lost trust on her and went to some other very senior doctor in Lilavati Hospital he has clearly mentioned that as an Gasterology specialist no doctor can prescribe medicines for High Blood pressure and Diabetes If any doctor is prescribed such then its total money making business of doctor
By having such rude and unprofessional doctors  Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital are keeping the reputation at stake The similar kind of experiences behavioural issues was faced by many patients in the recent past

The most impatience doctor Not ready to hear the patient out completely Harsh in her approach Not at all friendly Has a severe attitude problem She taunts her patient to come with family She mocks the patience No empathy In 25 years she must have gained experience but is only she knew how to deal with sick patience Would never recommend her to anyone

I am not sure why people have such negative experience I have consulted with few more big doctors but she is the best In the current world I have not found a single doctor who thinks so much for her patients and also helps to save medicine and lab costs She always support me whenever required which not a single doctor entertain offline She has already lot of patients so only you will miss a good doctor

This is on behalf of my mother Shabana Shaikh

As a person who suffered at the hands of some of the biggest doctors in the city who mostly contributed to worsening my health instead of curing me  meeting Dr Billa came as a blessingI met her in the winter of 2010 suffering from severe jaundice In our initial meeting she spent considerable time understanding my medical history rather than just jumping to giving her prescription In my next consultation with her she explained to me the root cause of my repeated infections  something that had been blatantly ignored by the most prominent doctors in Mumbai From then onwards began my journey of trust  resilience and cure with DrBilla Over the last 11 years of my treatment with her I have found her to be an extremely kind intelligent and compassionate individual who strives to help her patients in the best possible manner Her in depth knowledge and intellect makes her one of the most exquisite doctors in the profession Not only has my health improved but she has always been genuine in guiding me In todays world where doctors are merely concerned with filling their pockets and disregarding the patient and their emotions  something I have experienced DrBilla is in the truest sense of the words a DOCTOR An individual who does everything in her capacity to help her patients recover I will forever be grateful to her
