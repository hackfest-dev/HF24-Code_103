I had so many inhibitions about pregnancy and child birth But she is my saviour who helped me immensely in successfully delivering both my kids I had uterine prolapse since my first pregnancy she gave me the confidence to complete my pregnancy journeys both the times with absolute bliss I had both my delivery in the early morning hours and she was present on time and guided me throughout She helped me in vaginally birthing both my kids The confidence I get when I meet her cannot be put in words Never does an internal examination unless and until its really required Has always patiently answered all my queries Ensures the patient is comfortable and relaxed She is my unexpected best find I would be ever grateful to her for helping me birth both my babies

Best Gynaecologist Doctor and she prefers normal delivery100
Luckily we got suggestion to go Dr Prema Latha
We met doctor guided me throughout our pregnancy to normal delivery
Doctor will not prefer any unnecessary medicine and test
If any one is near to Adyar I would definitely recommend everyone to consult with Dr Prema Latha
Thank you so much Doctor

Doctor Premalatha Balachandar  we have to say God really helped us to find this doctor and they way she guided my wife for the delivery is tremendous Also her patience and captain cool attitude during the delivery process is marvelous and I would say because of her my wife delivered the baby safely through normal delivery Definitely the best gynecologist in India

She is very professional and no non sense doctor From the day one we felt very comfortable with her and we loved her simple approach She would always put a positive thought on the mind of the patient The entire period of pregnancy was smooth because she made us feel its all normal and nothing to worry She prescribed very minimal medicines  just pushed for regular exercise She will clearly explain every queries about pregnancy   about the babys growth at regular intervals The staff at the clinic is also very polite and helpful You should definitely consult if you are looking for a good doctor for your pregnancy

A phenomenal doctor She was an inspiration and took care of me till the end I wouldnt have had normal delivery if not for her Shes so quick in making the right decisions Never made me feel bad in any of my consultations Just asked me to exercise and walk regularly Understood my cues during the pushing process Understood what kind of patient I am Happy to have tumbled upon her and having a happy pregnancy

I would strongly recommend this doctor for a happy Pregnancy Journey She is a very positive doctor and treat everything right without complicating things She explains all your doubts and make you feel so positive on ur pregnancy  I had both of my pregnancies normal delivery with her and have recommended her to few of my friends and family we all had normal delivery If youre looking for an expertise in normal delivery she is the one I would recommend

I visited her during my  4th month of pregnancy for high risk pregnancy  She explained me very patiently about the complications and treated me well Though I got gestational diabetes in my 6th month she took good care and in my 38th week induced labor pain waited for 36 hours and I delivered a healthy baby girl vaginally

I would highly recommend Dr Premlatha for all pregnant women

Thank you Dr
