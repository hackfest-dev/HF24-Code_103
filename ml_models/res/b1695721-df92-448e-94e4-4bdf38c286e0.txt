Dr Singhi has a magnificent yet simple approach towards diagnosis and treatment He is very thorough and scrutinises the intricacies with utmost precision I am really satisfied after consulting him and his consultations boost confidence in patients

I am very thankful to him for his detailed diagnosis and medical advice
Apart from excelling in his medical profession he is a very good human being as well

My son Sandeep had to undergo a device implant to treat his hole in the heart condition which got detected only at the age of 19 We approached Medica Hospital Kolkata through our corporate hospital TMH Jamshedpur My experience was extremely satisfying Dr Anil Singhi who treated my son explained the entire procedure in detail and admitted my son the same day and the intervention was done the very next day We were later explained and shown the entire process Dr Singhi came as angel to treat my sons condition It is now about 2 months since the intervention He is absolutely normal now and going through life normally staying in a hostel in Bengaluru where he is studying This was also confirmed in the follow up checkup which was done after 5 weeks Very good care was taken while he was at the hospital and he was discharged in less than 48 hours I express my heartfelt gratitude to the hospital and Dr Singhi I would like to assure all such patients and their parents that this is a very safe procedure and should be undergone if such a situation is detected

I would like to share my experience with Dr Anil Kumar Singhi who happens to be my mothers childhood friend He is a renowned pediatric cardiologist who always takes the best care of his patients and gives the best possible advice When we were desperately in need of advice regarding my condition increased size of right ventricle due to absence of pulmonary valve as a result of TOF surgery on birth we thought of seeking his expert opinion He performed the necessary checkups and explained the whole situation patiently and in a way that even someone with no medical background would be able to understand On his advice we flew to MMM Hospital in Chennai and I had the surgery done under expert care The whole situation was handled professionally and smoothly and a large part of that was due to Dr Anil Singhi

Getting a Doctor like him is a grace of God Many famous Doctors suggest us to go for open heart surgery for ASD closure of my wife who is aged 35 But Dr Kunal Sarkar probably the best cardio surgeon in Kolkata and The best advisor in my life suggest me to
take consultation from Dr Singhi On our first visit Dr Singhi assured us that it can be closed by device closure procedure and she will get discharged on the very next day from hospital On his assurance we went for the procedure and the whole thing was same as he described She got discharged from the hospital on the very next day of the procedure Within 2 days my wife started doing her regular normal work without any restrictions as suggested by Dr Singhi Now after 6 months Eco cadio shows the wholeis completely closed and she has required no further medications nothing Thank you Doctor 

When our 6 month old was diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect it was hard to accept it On visiting DrAnil Singhi we understood that heart diseases are quite common among babies and can be treated easily We realised the same during our course of treatment that heart diseases exist at large among kids of all ages and are curable I would like to acknowledge the fact that having faith on your doctor makes the  journey of treatment go by smoothly Our daughters heart has healed and she is leading a normal life in every aspect
Heartfelt thanks to the medical practitioners
