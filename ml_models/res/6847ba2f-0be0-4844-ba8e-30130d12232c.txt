Good hospitality and excellent medical treatment He is treating all patients as like a  brother and he will advise how we can come out from the problem Doctor is supporring all patient each and every angles without any issues

Very bad experience because the doctors did not consult amongst them whether my wife was ist stage cancer patient at that time What should be proper treatment after surgery They said nothing required now Result of it within one and half months cancer come at neck from tongue now I dont know what is future Just careless ness through ourselves in a hard hard condition

We have been doing consultation with Dr Duraisamy Sir for more than two years We are highly satisfied with his treatment guidance judgement and suggestions  from our experiences during the course of  treatment and post treatment My Father in Law was a head and neck cancer patient two years back He is fully recovered now and leds a normal life We highly recommend Dr Duraisamy Sir

Excellent Doctor with good behaviour and explaining each and every details to patient or patient familyWe should comply Doctors advice and follow up procedure

Thank You Doctor

Very good doctor in cancer
