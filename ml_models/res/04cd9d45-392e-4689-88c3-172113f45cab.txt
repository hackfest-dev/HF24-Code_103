Dr Gagan Gautam is a God like figure He is so kind and very much transparent with the patient regarding any issue also the way he deals with the patient it regains the confidence level of the patient in itself

What strikes me most about Dr Gagan Gautam and his team is their endeavor to make the patient  his entire family comfortable with the procedure

They explained the concept of robotic surgery and how technological advancements in the medical fields have made prostate removal surgery more efficient

Dr Gautam is very competent and his speclisation in this surgery with ease of handling what he does made me approach the surgery in a positive and confident manner

His team handled the pre and post surgery process very efficiently and were constantly monitoring and guiding

10 days after surgery I feel completely healthy and active and express my heartfelt gratitude to this talented team at Medanta Hospital

I came across Dr Gagan Gautam recently in Medanta Hospital Gurgaon in context with my surgery for CA Prostate I underwent RARP conducted by him and his team It was an uneventful and successful surgery Post surgery I am very comfortable and recovering steadily

During my interactions with him both pre and postsurgery I found him to be a very pleasant and cheerful doctor who attends his patients with extreme warmth and affection He listens to them with patience and explains every aspect of the proposed treatment

I come from a family of doctors and am one myself and I can vouch for the fact that Ive rarely come across a doctor with so much grace and warmth No matter how hard pressed for time he and his team go the last mile to ensure that each  every patient is given individual attention to the patients entire satisfaction No wonder he is the most sought after Robotic Onco Urology Surgeon

Personally I feel that Dr Gagan Gautam is an Icon in the field of Robotic Onco Urology Surgery
I wish him and his team all the success in their future endeavors and hope they bring more laurels to themselves as well as the country in time to come

Doctor Gagan Gautam is soft spoken helpfull and down to earth man and explains everything in details telling all the pros and cons repercussions of the process he is contemplating to carry out He replies to all the questions including uncomfortable ones like how many surgeries have been done by him and even the success rate I was fortunate to have been referred to him Its now five years of the operation and with the grace of God and  Doctor Gautams skills I am doing fine BTW he still replies to my queries God bless him

Really a very kind and compassionate surgeon with expertise in robotics He maintains very polite communication with his patient explains the disease condition and treatment in detail Would definitely recommend him to anyone wanting to have an adrenal adenoma removed Great experience indeed
