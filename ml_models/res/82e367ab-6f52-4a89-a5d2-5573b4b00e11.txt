Since last one year getting treatment under him for my regrowing brain cancer cells
With the latest MRI report says that the condition is stable and current medications is working on it positively
Happy to be getting treated under Doctor Ankur
Suggestion for other cancer patients oncedo consultation with him
Regards


Dr Ankur is a very bad and selfish doctor His treatment is very bad My friend mother was not treated properly and he try to earn more profit by providing treatments which are not suitable for patients

I have experienced worst treatment of my life under Dr Ankul Bahl Will not recommend anyone to admit under this insensitive materialistic doctor ever He has no sympathy and manner to talk to patients and relatives Pathetic My hand is still swallowed because of IV cannolizaltion treatment he has given for chemo and he has no accountability for that

Disgusting behaviour and pathetic excuse for a human being Completely mannerless and emotionlessMy father was diagnosed with Glioblastoma and we did not know how to break the news to him and this brainless idiot said he would break the news sensitively and instead said the most horrible things to my dad instead of giving him hope He scared my father by saying he would become bed ridden and develop neurological deficits within weeks Thankfully we never went back to him and my father was with us for more than a year after that Please never go to him Such doctors should be boycotted from their profession

Dr  Ankur is a very bad doctor  He is a hired doctor in Fortis Hospital to earn more profit  His treatment is very bad  My mother was treated very badly  Which we understand later

We consulted Dr Ankur bhal for our mother treatment  Before taking his treatment she was able to walk eat and manage to do all things by herself but after getting his treatment which is chemotherapy  her health gradually falling and after completion of first cycle of chemotherapy she get a brain stroke and did not able to talk and eat and she started losing this health day by day
Finally he said that he cant do now as she didnt recovered from brain stroke and told us to take her to home and start BSCbest supporting  care
As my mother is no more now and cant express what we are feeling I request all not to choose him for your love one treatment

We had a very bad experience with this doctor He ignored our patient during critical moments and overlooked important tests before proceeding with immunotherapy which turned out to be useless I highly recommend everyone not to choose him as their physician

Consulted Dr Ankur Bahl for my mother in laws treatment She passed away Fortis is the highly mismanaged hospital We had terrible experience If you care about your loved ones please dont visit

This is just another Max hospital with same terrible service like any other max

They will make money out of you by first pushing for a surgery and tell you that you will be fine after the surgery

They will then admit you in the hospital at the earliest possible

Once admitted then they will start doing useless and unnecessary tests

After making money on tests then they will say you are fine now and we will do your surgery after we take cardiac clearance to make sure it is safe to do your operation

You will not believe that the doctors here have target given when they get employed at any MAX HOSPITAL that every month they have to generate revenue for the hospital of a given amount

They will do anything to ensure to make money to generate revenue for the Hospital

They will not give you cardiac clearance and then tell you that we will have to treat your heart first before we can do your surgery and because of that they keep in hospital for another couple of days to make more money

THE USE CARDIAC CLEARANCE AS AN EXCUSE FOR MAKING MORE MONEY OUT OF YOU

This MAX HOSPITAL

No ethics it seems a big scam going in billing Be careful to check your bills item wise before making full payment Terrible TPA service Took 3 times the cost of the estimate they provided for a simple known procedure Nursing staff needs to be reminded of their work Dont even bother for senior citizens Took 8hours for discharge process Pathetic services overall Our doctor was excellent but pathetic management Staff was reluctant to share their full names and email id for complaints
Would not at all recommend to anyone I will take a strong action against them
