Disappointed Careless and arrogant doctor
Im writing this after 5 months First thing doctor doesnt perform surgery his assistant do and he is not a plastic surgeon
Second thing at the time of complexity you cant talk to doctor I requested many times to his manager but he dont arrange a conversation I was ready for any time when doctor is free
And finally I dont get the expected result
Why Im saying he is arrogant because after many request you cant talk to the doctor you have to send pic then his assistant will send you the solution
My chest is not symmetrical because right aerola center nipple is disappear and he doesnt bother about it

This place is amazing I cannot explain in short  I have done my Hair transplant on 16123 since then I have become a fan of Bain ClinicI think I can give a good review because it has been some time that i have done the surgery and also I visited the clinic several times for PRP in the last 78 months
First of all I would say the main Reason to visit Bain clinic is Dr Bain himself his humility genuineness and the warm touch to everyone is beyond words second thing is the cost which is very very reasonable if you compare with any good clinic in Kolkata or outside the state it is unbeatable The hygene standard they maintain is awesome Sometimes I wonder how reasonable they are  giving their goods and services to the customers where other institutions in the same profession is looting people
Coming to Staffsthey are very caringgenerous and have a human touch specially Mr Ishwar Zahir and all of them whose names I dont know
I am sure Mr Bain and team would go a very long way because of their ethics and honesty that they shower on everyone that visits It is besides the point that my result of transplant is more than that i expected I wish all of them success and prosperity
If I have missed  any point I would add it up in my next review
God bless Bain Clinic

Good service for bain clinic
Im very happy to do my gynaecomastia surgery
Bain clinic management is very nice

Very good experience Dr Bain is very professional and generous person Staffs are also very well mannered I recommend everyone who are interested to consult any plastic surgent

This clinic would be definitely recommended from my end I have just done my surgery here a month ago We can consider this clinic as the best clinic in Kolkata

However regarding PostOperative guidancefollowup its needs to improve a lot

Behaviour is very good Thank you Bain clinic Behaviour of Dr Bain sir is very nice like a brother

I called the clinic to inquire about phimosis for kids and I was immediately told that they do perform surgery on kids Ive never seen any surgeon clearly stating what he is comfortable and what he is not comfortable to perform Though Ive not taken their service I can strongly recommend this place to anyone since people are at experienced hands only  the surgeon doesnt experiment just to make few bucks Hats off to the honesty and integrity
Why Im Impressed Ive been offered to perform a surgery by a renowned surgeon in a topnotch hospital in Kolkata a few weeks back for adenoid surgery for my son while later on I discovered that the surgeon has never performed the surgery using coblation method latest technique He misspelled coblation also just because I had mispronounced it

I have really good experience
All staff s behaviour are really very good
And Dr Jayanta bain is very experienced surgeon 

Recently i have done breast augmentation from here i just want to tell it was my best decision as the behaviour of the doctors and staff is impeccable they are very cooperative and helpful The doctors and staff really look after their patients And the environment and my overall experience was very good and positive
