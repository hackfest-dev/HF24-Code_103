My mother was having extreme pain in her right knee consulted many orthopedic doctors for opinions and finally went with Dr Karthik Pingle who suggested a TKR Dr Karthik is very personable  accessible The line of treatment was explained clearly
The surgery was successful and follow up visits were right on point I would recommend Dr Karthik Pingle for TKR
