Dr Mihir Bapat is one of the best doctor I have ever meet He is having so positive vibes and very clear on the Diagnosis and Procedure part
I had undergone for slip disc surgery He had done the surgery so smoothly that my life is very normal now and painless Initial few months we had to take the precautions as said by doctor so that surgery part get stable and recovers well
It was my pleasure to being operated by Dr Mihir Bapat and thank you to him for making me well and happy 

I think he is the best spine surgeon in India My father whose half body got paralysed after an unfortunate accident He got bedridden while having treatment we changed almost 3 doctors and so hospitals Thank God somebody suggested us about Dr Mihir Bapat We consulted him yes he did surgery and now all good My father is now able to walk Its been 5 years and he is doing great We are so greatful of Dr Bapat

I was suffering from cervical and lumbar disc bulges for nearly a year and my symptoms were gradually getting worse and it came to a point where I had issues with gait and balance
Consulted several doctors and all took a non surgical conservative approach as my symptoms got worse

Then I emailed my reports to Dr Bapat who also suggested 2 surgeries one for my lumbar disc and the other for the cervical disc pending an in person examination
After a personal examination he ruled out lumbar surgery and prescribed surgery only for the cervical disc
Happy to say within days I was walking and within months most of my gait and balance issues were gone And also some of the tingling and numbness were fine but not completely as I understand its a much longer process for the nerves to heal completely

Have to mention the other doctors of the team whos sister beautifully namely Dr Madhav Reddy Dr Bharat and Dr anudeep

Also my stay at the hospital was pleasant with all the support and nursing staff also being very helpful and polite and always willing to help

To me hes next to God I am pleasantly surprised to see a doctor of his stature so extremely humble down to earth soft spoken and approachable not only hes a great doctor but a much greater human being  This review was posted a year ago for Dr Mihir Bapat and not Dr Neelima mantri  Do not know why suddenly Dr Bapats name is replaced with someone else

Best spine surgeon He helped fix the failed spine surgery done by Dr Agarwal on my husband
Dr Mihir bapat diagnosed the problem in the surgery done and rectified it  And my husband is perfectly fine past 9years No complaints at all
Thank you Dr Mihir
