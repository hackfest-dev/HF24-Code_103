Rana sir is the best urologist

Dr Rana is a best one in Delhi He treats the Patients  as like his own family members He console the Patient in a very good way I recommend him the best urologist in my opinion For any query regarding urology sexology and renal stones and renal transplant uh can call him

No doubt Dr Rana and co doctor Swatantra Kumar are goodbut somewhat they are negligence When lithotripsy are being under process niether doctor are present to observe the process They are totally dependent on the technician resulting stones remains and patient are told that stone is cleared Resulting patient and guardians remain under mental trauma when problem erupt again  If this hospital says that there is no stone one must recheck it from taking ultrasound from outside clinic
