Sadly I read the reviews only after my visit to this obnoxious doctor Im quite surprised that inspite of so many negative reviews the hospital hasnt taken any action against this so called doctor because his attitude remains unchanged till date
My husband and me unfortunately had the opportunity to meet him for consultation and the arrogant egoistic behaviour said a lot about the doctor himself he lacks EMPATHY We were shocked that someone of that caliber can speak to his patients especially whom hes meeting for the first time he went on berating and speaking condescendingly and left no opportunity to add sarcasm to every statement he made
His cabin was so shabby and untidy which said a lot about his mental capabilities
Please do not waste your time going to him he doesnt deserve that single star given to himgoogle doesnt give an option of no stars for such uncouth people who sadly is a DOCTOR

I have never seen so much Arrogance  rudeness with a doctor 
This persons assistant give appointments and make us wait the whole day and in the evening after making wait for whole day refuses to c my Dad and arrogantly say that take another appointment  After 2 mths We explained tht we had to take some time before we plan for surgery of my dad but according to him he means why did we come after 6 mths and the rudeness and no empathy towards paitent he say tht you have to come personally to take the appointment

Shame on you Prashant nair You are a doctor not a Businessman

The hospital is a bit costly compared to other hospitals but any treatment can be completed without any worry if you have money

A prior appointment is needed to consult any doctor My dad had heart attack and he was under care of Dr Prashant Nair We had to come every three months for follow up with him

Good doctor but to keep up with appointments he is very slow and unpredictable We had appointment with him for 22nd February 2024 at 2pm which got cancelled on 22nd at 130pm We tried calling to reschedule another appointment but not available for few months

We tried calling OPD every day to find out if someone can give us confirmation or any other time and day

Not getting any response from the office

Finally we got a call to see him between 10am to 1pm on Monday on 26th February As I am typing this review  I am at the hospital waiting to see doctor Time is 2pm and still there is no sign of us seeing him I was told that there will be another two hours wait

I dont know whether it is  Due to high demand or lack of time management with Doctors

we need to wait for about 6 hours to consult with a doctor

The doctors whom we consulted are very well behaved and try to resolve every problem with detail

The nurses and staff are very helpful and friendly

The infrastructure is upto date but needs some renovation at some of the sections Especially in cafeteria tables are not cleaned no one to clear the table or areas to keep clean so other people can sit and eat

Im writing this to express my disappointment and concern regarding suboptimal angioplasty performed in 2016 by him Regrettably due to this oversight we were compelled to undergo a bypassCABG procedure in 2024 This has not only been emotionally and physically taxing but has also raised questions about the initial care providedOne of the best surgeon in India who performed surgery on my father raised concerns that  he should have put three stents where blockages were more than 80 instead of just one  raising serious doubts about the thoroughness and quality of the intervention
Also when we asked questions to him  he was reluctant to answer Very rude and apathetic doctor Ive ever seen

Rude frustrated doctor resulting in absolute waste of money and time Shocking that a reputed hospital with the likes of Dr Jamshed Dalal and other good doctors are hosting this kind of a person He despises NRI customers and makes personal remarks despite working in a hospital which charges elevated pricing for NRI patients

Hes most arrogant  and egoistic person Ive ever seen I feel ashamed to call him a doctor He probably has skipped the classes of medical ethics All he cares about is filling his own pocket He talks to patients and his family members as if he has done some kind of favour on them Very rude  doesnt even clear doubts All he cares about is his fees and unnecessary procedures which he prescribes to patients Please find some other doctor for your near ones Dont ever go to him Hes surely the worst

My wife was operated at kokilaben for heart valve replacement Since then he was treating her for the last 10 years Every follow up 2D was taken Last year the radiologist at 2D  called him to view the 2D due to pulmonary hypertension he refused to see her Later his secretary told us to make a payment so that he will see my wife for further treatment After making payment and also she is taking treatment from him for the last 10 years he refused to see her and allowed to travel her with such a high pulmonary hypertension He is a ruthless and egoistic person Good doctors duty is to save human being I am ashamed to call him as a doctor Will not recommend him even to my enemies also Shameful She could have been saved if the treatment was given on time I lost my loving wife
He has only EGO EGO EGO EGO NOTHING WE BELIEVED IN HIM MY MISTAKE

I was diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism due to my leg injury Dr Nair made me recover within 48 hours and I was discharged from hospital in 4 days  which usually takes around 10 days to recover He was also extremely polite with me and my family and makes you feel comfortable

The only thing Prashant Nair cares about is to fill his quota of bed at Kokilaben We had admitted my grandfather because he was feeling a bit restless After keeping him in ICU for almost 16 hours the doctor said that we will have to undergo angiography No explanation was given When we said we would like to take opinion from other doctors as well the hospital staff started acting rude They started carrying out unnecessary tests When I tried to enquire about the 2d echo the doctor was not at all interested in explaining anything and told us to come and see him in his OPD for further consultation

They denied us discharge as well At the end I had to force them to let me sign a DAMA which they did not let me do They purposely delayed the discharge saying that the tests reports are not ready yet Even after waiting for 7 hours for discharge we were not handed the test reports

The nurses are not at all trained They cant even speak Hindi or English

On further diagnosis of my grandfather we found out that his symptoms were because of a normal viral and was not at all cardiac related

This doctor is partly responsible for my mothers deteriorating condition and eventually her death He has been her doctor for 10 years and still refused to see her reports in September 2022 The 2D Echo technician told him that there is something wrong with her reports and we even paid for consultation but he still did not see her after waiting there for many hours He sent us home and told to message him on WhatsApp My mother was supposed to fly for a trip and asked him whether she is allowed to travel but even after the reports were abnormal he told her that she can travel This travel is what caused her to succumb eventually because of her deteriorating heart condition He will never give you time or even attention so please do not go to this doctor
