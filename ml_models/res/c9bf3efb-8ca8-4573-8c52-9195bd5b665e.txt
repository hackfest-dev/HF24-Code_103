Dr Atul Sharma is a very thoughtful and detailoriented man He would spend time in examining each report thoroughly and not rush to making a decision Throughout the conversation he would collect facts of the case and then summarise his understanding in a very lucid manner

I visited with my uncle who had been undergoing medical tests at numerous centers Dr Sharma acknowledged and made note of all tests previously done At the end of the conversation he played the role of a mentor and counsellor as much as that of a doctor

We will go ahead with his recommendations and are highly hopeful of a desired outcome
