Dr Sonawane operated my mother for incisional hernia and  the surgery was successful with no complications My mother is a cancer survivor so the surgery was a bit complicated but Dr Sonawane handled things very professionally and gave the patient and family confidence and clear risks of the surgical procedure The doctor is not after money or does not ask you to do surgeries unnecessarily
Our entire family would recommend Dr Sonawane and thank him from the bottom of our hearts

Avoid avoid No post operative care no explanation of illness no guidance  money orientedit was a simplest possible surgery  but recovery was extended due to lack of post operative carehe doesnt have any accountability on postoperation doesnt visit doesnt guide ambani hospital should be careful on appointing such doctorstotally avoid

 We visited for a chronic and recurrent GI ailment for which we had been told to get a surgery done by someone else
We visited Dr Sonawane for the same and he did a thorough examination of patient looked at previous papers did a repeat CECT abdomen and followed up with the radiologist for granular details and had a very frank discussion with us about the outcome we could expect
 Dr Sonawane answered all our queries very patiently and calmly and was very upfront and clear about the condition

Came across as someone whose first impulse isnt to extract the maximum from you but to actualy give you the best treatment which suits youand not him 

Incompetent and Unskilled doctor Good for nothing He could easily botch up any normal surgery Wonder how and on what basis hospital management in Kokilaben hire doctors  One thing is sure quite a few doctors in OPD of Kokilaben are very unfriendly and unprofessional with patients I have experienced it time and again Once surgery is over there is no proper interest in the patients health from doctors side

Totally useless physician Was too scared to operate on the gall bladder of my parent after cardiologist Dr Kahale said there was heart risk and wanted the patient to come to his OPD after a week so he could earn more money Sonewane discharged a critically ill patient  stating in the discharge report that she was stable Kahale is another useless doctor who I had a previous bad experience  with he had also asked me to come after a week  and when I went he just signed the NOC without even looking at the report   Sonewane did not exercise good judgement in informing that a he was too scared to operate b made a errorof judgement by releasing the patient c AFter the patient was admitted fo  emergency tried to experiment and did not even bother to meet the relatives after the third day when situation worsened My parent also had to suffer the rude nurses at the Kokilabenhospital  and further experimentation with her medicines led to her death HAd Kahale bothered to pay emergency attention and Sonewane not discharged the patient my parent would be alive today I do not recommend this character

Personal experience was not good  No treatment given just paracetamol and acidity tab The case was severe still not treated the dr from other hospital Said this needs to be cured as soon as possible 

Never recommend to anyone Poor treatment and very unskilled doctor not confident for his patients Just wants to earn and nothing else Not good to patients
Personal experience

Bogus doctor his treatment didnt work at all only charges a lot Dont even wanna give 1 star

Very nice and polite doctor

Extremely useless doctor
