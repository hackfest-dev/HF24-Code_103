Having to deal with diagnosis of cancer for self or a loved one is stressful enough and finding the best doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment should not be Dr Santosh performed prostrate removal surgery robotic for my 77 year old dad in Sept21 We consulted several doctors in the beginning but ultimately decided to go with Dr Santosh and his team for the required prostrateremoval procedure Our personal experience all the way from initial consultation to postsurgery care has pleasantly exceeded our expectations Not only is Dr Santosh an excellent surgeon he is also very good at connecting with his patients and their relatives He openly welcomed our endless questions and patiently answered them to our satisfaction The empathy the doctor and his team expressed throughout went a long way in making the entire process much more stress free for us We were clearly advised of all considerations prepost surgery which helped avoid any surprises throughout the process The surgery went as planned and expected and my dad is on the path to recovery The Dr and his team maintain contact post surgery to ensure everything is OK We are truly blessed to have found Dr Santosh and are thankful for receiving the best treatment and care for my dads medical condition

Kudos to Dr Santosh and his entire team I was very skeptical during my first visit after my initial diagnosis by my GP but Dr Santosh patiently explained the situation and the possible options including surgical In the entire preoperative and postoperative phase his entire team was very supportive and put me at ease The operation went off very well and I can confidently say that I was in safest hands with Dr Santosh Unlike most senior doctors Dr Santosh was always available to answer queries personally and on the phone and most importantly he and his team gave regular updates to my family during the operation

Thank you Doctor and your entire team for the treatment and all the care

I am delighted to have the opportunity of giving a feedback here

I have always been saying since I visited Dr Santoshs team in KDAH that he and his subordinate doctors in the team are totally devoted to the profession and cooperative with the patients as I felt in my case The successful robotic surgery of my renal cancerous tumor is proof of it And the best thing was the way Dr Santosh and other doctors specifically Dr Vibushit encouraged me to fight with the post surgery discomforts That helped me a lot to have a quick recovery I am really grateful

It would be unfair if I dont mention one thing I believe you expect an honest opinion from me My experiences with most of the nursing staff who were on duty during my admission period were not good I would say they are not properly trained Some of them looked like they were reluctant to serve the patients The patients have to take care on their own whether the fluidinjection is actually passing or not if it is already finished Would be good if the doctors can take care of these things and ensure nursing for the patients

In the end thank you Dr Santosh very much for helping me to get rid of the worst situation of my life

Doctor Santosh and his team are the best Since our day1 visit for diagnosis through operation and now ongoing postoperative care for my fathers prostate cancer treatment he has always guided us in the right direction and given him the best treatment I and my entire family are extremely thankful to everything he has done for us I would strongly recommend him to anyone and everyone
Thank you

We liked Dr Santoshs way of describing the problem with patient and relatives It was easier for us to understand the minute details of the ailment and how the treatment would be like Even during surgery he would update us timely about what is going on inside the OT and that eases a lot of tension during major operations A confident doctor with good command in his domain

Special mention to Dr Varun and Dr Aakash who made the process easier for us during this tough time Always approachable they add up to form a great team along with Dr Santosh

I would definitely recommend Dr Santosh
