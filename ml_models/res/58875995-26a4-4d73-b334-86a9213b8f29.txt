The most excellent hematologist that I have ever met out of 25 Ten times better compared  to all French hematologists Because he genuinely cares about his patients and want to save their lives He is pragmatic and efficient He saved my life in a few days after two years nightmare in Europe  It was really worth the difficult trip  travelling so far from France in a weak state  Thank you

He is not intersted with his patients only sitting like a manager in his hospital  after getting prior appointment we are compelled to consult with his subordinate only though we went there with a great hope from 2300km away His subordinate is not well experience and not confident in diagnosis which compelled us to take treatment in Medanta hospital

I Dont understand how hes done more than 1000 BMTs he doesnt even have manners to speak  talks more like an illiterate then a renowned doctor People who want to get disrespected and humilated do meet him  My genuine review   and his ultimate and only  solution is TRANSPLANT 

A true Sales man of Fortis not at all a  doctor works for profit only at least in my case as a international patient My experience if you want to stay alive and want real treatment for cancer go elsewhere Knows nothing other than prescribing imported medicine which gives him lot of commission God save the people from  these doctors who brings their profession to a disrepute His rude bunch of team members experimented on my patient which proved fatal Avoid if you want to stay alive God save the world

my husband is 30 years old and he is having PNH

can you please let me can this be cured 

Dr Rahul Bhargava is one of the best doctor of bone marrow transplant treatment  He has done bone marrow transplant treatment of my husband suffering from multiple myeloma yours doctor team is also best Thank you so much to get this plateform for transplant treatment
