Money minded doctor

Not worth it

He is not good at all

Charges too much only interested in insurance amount

Great Dr  great human being Hv tremendous knowledge of his sub He can boost ur confidence if u r low Has changed my life  1 point of time I will b always highly obliged to him

Had a very bad exp With doctor he is so much money minded I had a tongue ulcer so he has planned all togther Biopsy tongue surgery and neck dessection as well based on biopsy without refrring any PET scan or MR in hinduja hospital  And also advised me for rediation which I have taken but despite of that in december 21 I had recurrence in my Neck and since then struggling for my life and Cheemo and Immunotherpy in Tata Memorial since then

He is just useless doctor  He doesnt even know how to behave with the patient  He just take money calling 3 to 4 times  Rudely says d patient kuch nahi hai uatt jaa   

He doesnt no his job Plus this guy is running after money telling ppl to go for surgery as hes tied up with lot of hospitals

He is a great doctor His confidence level and knowledge is remarkable he is very friendly helpful and in short I cant explain his qualities in words

Not extra experience only big name its normal ent petients are no sticfy

Bahot hi 3rd class behaviour in short time waste hai inke paas janasolid attitude ghamndi  Pls mat jana

This doctor doesnt know how to behave with patient and secondly dont send your daughter or sister alone there you know what I mean

He is useless He keeps experimenting with medicine wasted my 8 days
