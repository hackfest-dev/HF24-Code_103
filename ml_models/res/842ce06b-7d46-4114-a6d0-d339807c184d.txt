Very bad experience with Dr kamath itna consulting Dene ke bd doc ne 5 min bi dhang se bt nhi ki aur nhi patient ko chck kiya ye sb expect nhi tha itne bade hospital se doc ko patient ke time aur money nhi h 130 ghanta late aaye doc very irresponsible

Got my burst appendix surgery done by Dr Kamat He is quite friendly explains the procedure well and very knowledgeable and experienced Recommended

Horrible experience with Dr Kamath in Nanavati hospital Despite categorically informing what not to do and what is not the problem the wrong medicine was administered causing huge inconvenience to my father I really dont know what to say

Thank you so much dr u r the best  

Very nice dr
