Dr is not good in behaviour he gets irritated on asking even single question
He has created a false aura around him as he is  vip and mpatient has no right to speak in front of him pts comes from so far and kept waiting for hrs even after taking pror appointments as there is no value of there time abo e allpaying 3000 rs as feetou can not ask even 3queztins to Dr
Reallyit seems he is just interested innumber of patients only

Totally money minded doctor He advised me colonoscopy thrice at Medanta Hospital Every Time they collect huge amount for the colonoscopy test  but they have never removed my Caecum Inflammatory Polyp Near The Ileum Valve in the colonoscopy test  have neither suggested any solution for it My diarrhoea  gas problem is same because of that

Money minded doctor
Doesnt pay attention to his patients only intrested in number of patients and passing down patients to his son sukrit sood
What he could have easily averted in my fathers case because of his negligence turned into a big operation
He should start paying attention to his patients and put his experience to some use

He is the best and most proficient doctor in the entire Asia Region his treatment is absolutely accurate and effective He recommends few tests to treat patients well he did recommend few tests to my father and we trusted him and followed his adviceMy father wasnt keeping well and low on haemoglobin now my father is doing well Thanks Doctor Randhir Sud
He is a busy man with so many patients running for him he is a blessing for all the patients He isnt business minded at all its just that he doesnt have time for any baseless questions

Dr Randhir Sud is one of a kind  You are truly blessed if you or your family is getting treated by him Brilliance would be a gross understatement to describe him He remembers every patients case and though he speaks less  he is extremely reassuring  He never creates a panic for his patients or their families My son was treated by him  We had transferred him from another hospital in a critical state but there wasnt a days panic after Dr Sud took over his case  He tells you the issue and in the same breath tells you how hes going to treat it  His diagnosis is always spot on and he doesnt believe in over medicating  He was God sent for us  Today our son is home  a happy man  all courtesy Dr Randhir Sud  May God bless him with a long  happy and healthy life  I cant really describe him well enough  words fail me  Its no wonder he is the best Gastroenterologist in our country He is a blessing to humanity  have personally witnessed how people look to him for advice  from all over the world  I really wish he reads this and knows how grateful I am  he is not one you can thank in person  hes just too humble and just makes light of everything he has done  

Pathetic experience
We went to Dr Randhir because of his experience But he transferred the case to his son Dr Sukrit Sud without informing us His son is very junior unprofessional inhuman rude illiterate careless has no human value We cannot even call him a doctor with his behavior I almost lost my father because of his mistake

They spoilt my fathers case created fistula a hole in the foodpipe during endoscopydilation and did not even inform us When we went to him again he did some swallow test which worsened my fathers condition and left my father choking breathless and extreme coughing  my father was in a dying condition Dr Sukrit did not take any preventive action he didnt even give the report of the test and told us very rudely that he cannot do anything and asked us to take our father away in a condition where other doctor would have called for critical response team Maybe he got frightened because he found about the fistula in the test and wanted to shoo us away
How come a son is practicing under his father in the same hospital This is clear conflict of interest Father being the mentor will never acknowledgeagree to his Sons mistakes Maybe Sukrit just got some degree using his fathers referencemoney
Overall pathetic experience with Medanta because of all this

He is worst doctor He is money minded the doctor did not provide appropriate treatment Doesnt pay attention to his patients only intrested in number of patients and passing down patients to his son sukrit sood Never go to this doctor for treatment

Zero rating only money minded Better to keep patient at home rather going to him Will pay for his experience but at last u find junior doctors treating ur patient

In one word He is the best nothing else I am suffering intestinal disease from last 16 years Under his observation  consulting I am stable at my current situation In an emergency if you are calling him he received the call every time  give the best solution Aapke call karne pr kabhi gussa nhi hote hain Dr sahab He is very soft spoken person always caring of his patient

Booked an appointment with Dr Randhir Sud for 21 Nov 22 but was first seen  diagnosed by his junior Met Dr Sud who was briefed by his junior  Dr Sud just wrote down the tests  medicines I paid for his experience not his junior
