Wait time is very long but it was worth it I visited him based on someones referral and I was completely satisfied Dr Dharmanand listened to my case patiently despite his busy schedule He reduced the dosage of medicines I was on and suggested dietary changes and exercises instead

My father is getting treatment for Ankylosing spondylitis from Dr Dharmanand and as per my personal experience he is the best doctor for Rheumatoid Arthritis Dr Dharmanand behavior towards his patient is very kind and humble He always listen to his patients problems very calmly and give his best treatment to his patients
I would like to thank the doctor and the receptionist specially Uma Maam for the support
I would highly recommend Dr Dharmanand Sir to others

Dr Dharmanand is THE doctor if you suffer from Rheumatoid or autoimmune disorder He is a genuine and a straight forward doctor with deep concern best  intentions  positive approach towards his patients I have been suffering for many years and all through my life I visited multiple doctors  Rheumatologists in India but none like him The staff is well organised and efficient they are very courteous and helpful

My mom was 48 years old when she started visiting this doctor at the Sakra world hospital

She was diagnosed initially with Arthritis The doctor prescribed her methotrexate for about 2 years He never checked her thoroughly neither did he inform us about the side effects of the tablet

After two years of continuously being on methotrexate my mother acquired lymphoma When we went back to him  to inform that she was diagnosed with cancer he yelled at my mother such an incompetent man and asked us to meet an oncologist

5 years from then she suffered lymphoma and today she is no more She passed away in 2021 after the cancer had spread too much

I accompanied my mother several times while she visited him He always made the patients wait forever and most of all extremely arrogant

My mother was his patient my grand mother was his patient and one of our family friends daughter the girl was only 18 years old None of them are with us anymore

I still know a lot of people around me diagnosed with arthritis and doing good with certain medication prescribed by different doctors There are several better doctors out there Please choose wisely

Very kind and experienced
He is the real meaning of DOCTOR

The doctor is very good but waiting there is torture There is no meaning of any appointment It always takes three hours  even with confirmed appointment

The support staff has to be sensitive to the wait time 

Cool and Cognizant
If you have to Consult Rheumatologist in Karnataka
Blindly go for Dr BG Dharmanand
