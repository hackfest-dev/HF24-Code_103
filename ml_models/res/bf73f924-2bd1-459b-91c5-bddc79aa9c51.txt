Thank you doctor

Did surgery of sinoplasty for nasal congestion in October 2020 but same problem facing after 6 months after that he is saying you have anxiety problem
So why did he procedure for sinoplasty

Very bad experience waste of time  money 

Surgery failed

I was suffering from a chronic ear condition which deteriorated significantly over time Visited a lot of doctors but none could diagnose the disease accurately I was then referred to Dr Badhwar by a family friend Dr Badhwar diagnosed the issue correctly during my first visit to him He recommended a surgery which was promptly done The surgery was a success and the infection was removed The aesthetics of the surgery were great too and there were no visible scars My hearing too has come back and I am back to leading a normal life Dr Badhwar is a thorough professional and a brilliant doctor His diagnosis was accurate The surgical procedure was smooth and painless and the medicines prescribed were just right no side effects not very strong while at the same time doing the job The post operative visits were also conducted very smoothly and thanks to his advice I am perfectly fine now I would highly recommend Dr Badhwar to anyone suffering from any ENT related issues

Sir u r excellent ent doctor but pl increase your timing for OPD as we r getting appointment after a week or more Near a week we r waiting for just your appointment Leave about pian and treatment
Hopeless to remain in pian for a week to get appointment of good doctor

I referred to Dr Sanjiv Badhwar through one of my friend Dr Badhwar is a thorough professional and a brilliant doctor His diagnosis was accurate The surgical procedure was smooth and painless and the medicines prescribed were just right no side effects not very strong The post operative visits were also conducted very smoothly and thanks to his advice I am perfectly fine now I would highly recommend Dr Badhwar to anyone suffering from any ENT related issues
Thanks to Dr Sanjiv Badhwar for the entire journey from first visit till follow up post surgery all effective
Dr Badhwar has excellent team  they are supportive and helpful in entire journey God bless to entire ent team

I got my Balloon Sinuplasty Bilateral FESS Septoplasty done from Mr Bhadwar Very genuine doctor assistant doctors are well trained and very helpful I was so scared of surgery but it well extremely smooth Thank you Dr Sanjiv Bhadwar and his team

Useless ent surgeon came to him  for
chronic difficulty breathing chronic oropharx disphagia that didnt solve previous surgury
2nd opinion Surgical treatment options when previous surgury failed and got addictional complianctions including
Severe tightness in Neck mandable  loss of gagreflexpartial speech lossvoice change and with more ASPIRATION done by Dr Chetan Gharat ENT SURGEON from bangli HOSPITAL Vasai we are paying so much for consultantion and ask help in bigger HOSPITALs yet yet what just antacids and spl consultantion

My experience there was not a good one
I did not feel satisfied He diagnosed me with reflux laryngitis throat inflammation due to acidity but never once stopped to ask me if I had ever experienced any issues of acidity  He barely spoke or asked me a proper history I was checked superficiallyThats still an overstatement and he may be right with his diagnosesI dont know yet but it wouldnt hurt to spend a little more time on your patient And making sure they understand and feel comfortable especially In a private set up where people pay for better services and when there was no other patient waiting in the opd

 Giving Tonsils surgery quotation of Rs  400000 

 He counts Tonsils surgery as major plus category This category is given for Open Heart Surgery

 If you want to ask any questions to him then his assistant answer you as he dont have time

 Very Rude in Nature

 Wont suggest him for any surgery

My first visit was good and the doctor made me do 3 different tests The diagnosis was fine However in my following visit the doctor barely gave me 30seconds and I didnt even get a chance to ask him any questions Sad experience
