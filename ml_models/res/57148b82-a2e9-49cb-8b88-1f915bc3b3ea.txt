Dr Sandhu is the best cardiologist My husband and mother in law got treatment from him My mother in law had artery blockage which he solved only by medicines where as other doctors suggested surgery He handles the situation very well and will never make you panic
They both are good now
It was 3 years back
And why I got a chance to give review today because one of my friend asked me about any good cardiologist  and one and only one name came in my mind Dr Sandhu 
Thanks Sir
Best wishes
