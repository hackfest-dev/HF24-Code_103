He is very rude  egoistic doctor  who does not listen to patient queries
He scolds even senior citizen patients in his attitude He has pathetic behavior issues

Please do not visit this doctor as he will inject his negative behavior as a mental scar in you

These doctors are just a gang of goons this one being part of the gang as well All they do is refer the patient to their gang members and let them get on with their loot Beware these jhola chaaps dont just work at their clinics but other hospitals as well They will make their money by referring you to these hospitals who are a bigger cartel I will never forget what they did to my father who is no more

He is the worst doctor My mom is no more because he misdiagnosed her For 4 months she was under his care and according to him she was not having any major problems She was later diagnosed with cancer and because of wrong medicines and late diagnosis she couldnt make it I would strongly advise people not to trust him

Very rude behaviour with pateints Writes lots of unwanted test to make commission and gets angry when you get those test done from somewhere else Please be aware of such doctors

Too egoistic doctor didnt want to hear patiently having anger issues and wants to just earn by keeping patients in loop faced by me almost he put me on gas depressed medications for almost 3 months not knowing i have gallstones and near to be operated IMMATURE AND MEAN DOC And this review is not a paidbias review as others have over here

Good Doctor for gastroenterologist in West Delhi
