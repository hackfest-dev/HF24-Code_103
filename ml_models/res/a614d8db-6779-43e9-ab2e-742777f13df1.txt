i got my detailed Sugar Flexi Complete health Checkup but surprise that Hopsital sent me without REVIEWING BY DOCTOR BATRA and even i m trying to contact hospital file my complain but no response  What is this   What is benefit of paying 17000 for this SUGAR FLEXI COMPLETE CHEKCUP if the concerned doctor is not reviewing and not suggesting any treatment

When I was gone here first time I have a lots of issueBefore going here I have tried some other hospital alsobut they are unable to diagnose my issue  properly when I met Dr C M B Batra he quickly identified the issue  provide proper resolution  now I am feeling goodThankyou very much sir to provide proper resolutionu r God for me

Poor syncing of apollo 247 app and presence of doctor Pathetic

I have been following Dr Chandra Mohan Batra Sir for the last 6 months I have seen a lot of improvement thanks Dr Sir

My mother consulted him for diabetes Cant say about his diagnosis but he is not very responsive with the patient

Pathetic Experience not recommended at all
