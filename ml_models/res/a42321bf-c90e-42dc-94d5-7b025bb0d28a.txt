Sorry but I have to share a truth that I had a bad experience Dr Rajagopalan and Dr Manoj did my back surgery and now I am in more worst situation On consulting with some better spine surgeons of Apollo hospital and other hospitals I got to know they diagnosed wrongly After few days of surgery I met with Dr Manoj he did not accepted that I stil have the same problem and that egoistic man given me medicine that is used for depression which I really think he needs to have those My opinion never go for any surgery or treatment in Apollo hospital

This doctor is great He treated Afsheen who had a very complex cervical spinal deformity successfully and has become international Check out the recent BBC article

I have a very bad expireince with himHe is a very arogant doctor he dont know how to talk with ladiesYou cant ask him about your problem if u ask then he start shouting on youhe only suggest surgery for your problemFurther his assistant Mr Manoj  he always misguided people about MRI and therapist

Worst experience Very arogant shooting every time assistance Dr only one thing money matters Dont care patient after operation Also become neurosurgeon Do operation of neurosurgeon whenever patient survive or not

Best doctor ever met withHighly successful person
