One of the 3rd Class Doctor I have ever seen in my lifemy father just passed away due to brain tumorbut when we met this 3rd class doctor in July he told us that nothing to worry he is in stress and gave him stress medicationbut rather my father had malignant tumorWhat Grade less doctor he is although we have asked for MRI but the doctor suggested not to go for MRI

Never go to such type of doctor
Our family deeply mourns for this incident

To me he is the best neurologist in Kolkata It might take 23 months to get his appointment but once you visit him you will realise that he is one of the best neurologist He is a genuine down to earth person and even better doctor He listens to all the issues patiently and goes through test reports in detail He gives very few medicines and recommends exercises You can take a video when he shows the exercises so that you dont forget it
If you want to see a neurologist just go for him without a second thought

One of the best doctor in Kolkata My mother is in his treatment and so far we have seen a remarkable improvement in my mothers health

We are very grateful to him for his continuing services towards the mankind

My elder sister has a rare neuro problem only he had indentified the problem in Kolkata He is genius

Excellent Doctor as a doctor he listen to patient very care fully His behavior is nice As a human being he is also very good

Irresponsible doctor Doesnot attend calls His medicine had adverse reactions to my father in lawwe contacted him several times but nobidy attended his call Today we are in complete mess as my father in law cannot even move from his bed and his health condition is irreversible Going to this doctor is my biggest regret
