My Brother was suffering from severe backpain and was unable to move properly for many months we consulted many Orthoapedic surgeons and all advised either bed rest or physiotherapy but the pain didnt get better We met Dr nikhil  as we were referred by a family friend after examining my brother and seeing the reports  he suggested a minimally invasive spine surgery he also explained the benefits of the surgery properly After discussion with our family we went ahead with the surgery  its now 4 months after the surgery and my brother is back to his normal routine and able to do all his work comfortably  I am thankful to dr nikhil and his team for the excellent results after such a delicate surgery

An incompetent nincompoop whose screwup resulted in parasthesias in my Right S1 root distribution On top of that when I complained to him about the pain and immobility he instead of owning upto it condescendingly suggested me to see a  psychiatrist because the MRI doesnt show a significant neural compression He needs to be taken off his high horse and held accountable Im even attaching the necessary documents supporting my acquisition

I am content with the minimal visits that I had to make in order to recover from spinal pain that I had for nearly about 67 weeks Dr Nikhil Arbatti diagnosed it in the first visit itself and gave only limited amount of medicines to get rid of my spinal pain Surely I would recommend him for his professional service

Dr Nikhil Arbatti is One of the best spine surgeons i have ever met His qualities  patience in hearing the problem right diagnosis  explaining the different modalities of treatment available appropriate treatment and most importantly following up the patient are highly appreciable
I personally recommend Dr Nikhil a thoroughly professional and knowledgeable surgeon  for your spine problems
