All d best to him

Words are not enough to express my gratitude for Dr Praveen Kahale
My father had a blockage and doctors had suggested for an open heart surgery but it was Dr Kahale who ensured us that angioplasty is sufficient
He is an incredible Dr He had taken great care of my dads health
He was very vigilant during the whole procedure and he with his team took utmost care that patient feels comfortable and least painful
Its rare to find a doctor that combines such a personal touch and care for a patient with an outstanding quality of medical care

Dr Pravin Kahale has a very light presenceContrary to that He is decisive on diagnosistests   treatmentHe is direct  honest with the patientI was reassured by his simple but frank behaviourHe is updated on latest medicines Open to communication whenever needed Thank you Dr Kahale

Very good cardiologist in kokilaben Ambani hospital I got cardiac arrest He handled the situation in emergency He has given me new life Very good diagnosis and treatment Thanks to him

I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for Dr Pravin Kahale Their dedication and expertise in the field of medicine have made a positive impact on countless lives Dr Kahales compassionate approach and commitment to providing quality care are truly commendable Their professionalism knowledge and ability to communicate effectively with patients make them an exceptional healthcare provider Thank you Dr Pravin Kahale for your outstanding service and for making a difference in the lives of so many Your contributions are greatly appreciated

He is just too good a doctor who cares about the patient a lot treating them with utmost care Thank you kokilaben hospital for accomodating dr pravin kahale He is an amazing doctor

My wife had a cardiac issueDr Pravin Kahale  is  a super suburb kind  of person my wife was under his treatment of artery blockageDr  very politely and in a simple way explained us the treatmentand did it very successfully We are so grateful and pleased by his way  to handle patients   and  give a perfect treatment Will recommend you and all to do treatment under himHe is a kind of magician A gem of person who is a perfect cardiovascular doctor among  the best I give 100 out of 100
Thanks Dr Pravin Kahale

Went to him for a few months after my heart attack Hes a good doctor but not at all reliable and definitely doesnt help that the Kokilaben hospital appointment system is a joke Better to stick with a doctor that has a boutique practice in my experience
