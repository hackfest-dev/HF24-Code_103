Positive Excellent experience  Doctor Tripti Dev is very very good No extra medicines  whatever is required Very friendly doctor and her assistant  I got Excellent result whatever medicine she gave Very very confident doctor with years of experience  My BP has become completely normal in just one week  I have no words to thank her God bless

I always consult Dr Tripti Deb whenever I have some health issue She is very sympathetic to her patients  When my wife BP shooted up too much I followed her advice and she became normal soon I am very grateful to her

When I first went to her she instantly met us nicely and told us to do tests  she sent a person to make sure u do the tests there only After that when my results came  I went to her again  and she didnt bother clarifying my doubts and made me wait one and half hour to ask one question And then when I asked her if I should continue the medicines or manage cholesterol with diet  she rudely told me that do what you want take it or leave it The consultation was over in two mins I never went again after that Its like she has different personalities

Im a very old patient of dr tripti Deb since 20 years  She had saved my life since 10 years Im very much happy with her consultation and treatment Highly recommended doctorplease

Felt full happy about fhe consultation Fully satisfied  Highly recommended doctor for carfiac doctor She is very swwet She treats evry patient like a family member I come all the way from Bangladesh for follow up to THIS doctor only

For the past two years DrTripti Deb has been  my primary consultant of my heart health after stent surgery           She patiently  listens and  clears all our questions   I am very happy with her treatment  I rate her as the best doctor I have ever met so far and I would recommend her to anyone

It was a great experience to meet Dr Tripti Deb  Her expertise attention and guidance is really valuable to us I feel very secured and protected in her presence and she has gifted me a safe and healthy life while treating me Her entire team and their coordination is  commendable Altogether it was a wonderful experience  for me

Dr Tripti Deb is an excellent Dr Im visiting her since 56 years for my BP Recently my father had an issue with his angiogram She did the angioplasty and it was very complicated Yet she did a great job and within 2 days my father is back to his normal life I highly recommend her as one of the best cardiologists in Apollo Jubilee hills

Met DrTripti Deb when i was feeling overwhelmed with panic attacks after suggesting few tests the problem was rightly pointed by her and with her suggestions was able to recover in a month She brings abundance of experience with her lifestyle suggestions I was able to overcome my underlying issues

Strongly suggest Dr Tripti Deb

Thanks

Waste of money via online video call With high BP she created a panic to immediately admit in ICU My mother condition was handled by using medication at home She could have told that please use this medicine and tomorrow you can consult a heart specialist But no she created such panic please rush to hospital and get angio done
