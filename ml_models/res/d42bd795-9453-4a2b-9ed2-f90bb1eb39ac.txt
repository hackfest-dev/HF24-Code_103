Extremely disappointed my husband cut his finger and he didnt even bother to inspect how deep the cut was Just randomly asked to get the surgery Doctor is atleast expected to inspect t the wound and suggest a course of action accordingly Least interested to serve his patients and give them the attention emergency demands

Very experienced Doctor and a gentle soul
Deals and cooperates with patients very politely and nicely
One of the best doctors of Kokilaben hospital
Very impressed  

Dr Quazi is well skilled plastic and reconstructive surgeon with calm and gentle nature He listens to patient and answers every query He further explains every procedure in detail which instills confidence and courage in his patients

There is a stigma in indian society for breast reconstruction surgery whether it is primaryimmediate or secondarydelayed Doctors like Dr Quazi helps rebuild lives of such patients who lost one or both of their breast due to cancer It is an important surgery to improve ones physical appearance and good mental healthDr Quazi is the best choice in the country to get such surgery done at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital at affordable prices

Dr Quazi is an accomplished surgeon  Plastic Surgeon   his amazing capabilities instil confidence in his patients  and with his impeccable calm and gentle  bedside manner he imbibes confidence in his patients   as it is so important to have faith in ones surgeon  as losing a breast is such a traumatic experience for a woman   not only aesthetically but mentally
I  recently went through a  reconstruction of my breast the result of which is so heartening  I returned from surgery in pain but was elated to know Dr Quazi had made me whole person again  with his extraordinary skill 
Women  treat  the procedure of  Breast Reconstruction  today  as a social stigma  and  are not aware about how important it is to have breast reconstruction  It is important for ones balance for the health of ones back and for the health of ones mind
I would advise all women young and old to go in for this type of reconstruction there is no stigma involved most countries today use this method Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Dr Quazi are the best choice for this today
