Dr Zope is very kind and helpful She care about her patients provided clear explanations and made me feel comfortable during my visit Overall experience was good

Very down to earth and very responsible towards her patients She is more of a doctor than a Businessman unlike other doctorsspecialists I have come across I would recommend every person going to kidney disorders to consult this wonderful doctor to get themselves treated Her staff is excellent supportive and helpful in nature

Very understanding and well qualified professional

Madam bohat hi humble n expert Dr hai Maine first time aisee dr dekhi hai jo patient ko hath lagate hi uski problem bata deti hai Mai ne 78 years unke under mai treatment liye mukta kidney n dialysis center mai dialysis pe hone ke baad bhi inka treatment bohat acha hota hai2012 to 2019 tak ek staff family ki tarah hi raha Thanks to all itni achi service dene ke liyeke liye

If I could give her seven stars I would do so After struggling of five years of painful illness including several times hospitalization in New Delhi I called my sister in law to Mumbai to consult Dr Zope She really listen and examined all previous repots with sufficient time to arrive at diagnosis and treatment plans My sister in law started recovering very fast due her proper medicinediagnosis with nominal cast as compared to previous expenditure I would definitely recommend her without any doubt We will remember her for caring concerned and professionalism

The visit was great Dr Zope guide me very well What Kind of care need to take She is good doctor

Highly recommended she explains very well the issues patients are facing  problems causing the chronic kidney diseases and benefits of control weight and blood pressure to avoid kidney dialysis
During my mothers first consultantion she took around 45 min to explain everything in detail  I highly recommend her for any kidney related issues
