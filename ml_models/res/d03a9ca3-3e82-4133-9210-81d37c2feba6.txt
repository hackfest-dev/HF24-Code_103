My wife would have died after discharge due to DVT which I cautioned her before the surgery She was so careless and least concern to her patients LIFE I should have sued her if l lost my wife

She did my hysterectomy and injured my bladder Very arrogant lady She asked me if I had urinary inconsistency before surgery She did internal examination and said there was no issue I was leaking urine for 8 months because she misguided urologist saying everything was fine Not even a sorry I got from her I had to go through trauma for 8 months got VVF repair done through Robotics surgery Very unprofessional All she knows is to judge people Age is just a number is for a person like you As you clearly have no compassion for patients Went to her with reference

I have PCOD but my periods were relatively regular until recently I went to visit her when I was not having my period after 40 days since lat one When we got to visit her she asked us if we want to have kids Our response being negative she replied she wont be able to help us and scared us that I might get cancer since I am unwilling to conceive I quote her You shouldnt think that you should buy a bungalow and helicopter and then youll think about having kids in your 40s She wasnt even aware of my family medical history Utterly ridiculous diagnosis Never visiting her again

Both my pregnancies were handled by her which were very different cases and not so easy I trust her experience more than todays  doctors technology usage and bookish knowledge which would have costed my second childs life She gave us the confidence and she was committed towards what she said
She is straight forward which many patients dont like
Infact none of my deliveries were fancy ones but were in best hospitals in Bangalore where others make big bills hers was alway reasonable and believe it or not I had only three scans in both pregnancies This might not be true anymore
I respect her very much and alway recommend her to my known ones when there is any complicated gynaecological problem

DrJaya Bhat is far and away the best doctor i hav ever met She is extremely intelligent a compassionate caring and a truely outstanding doc She is one of the most experienced doctor in BangaloreI count myself truely lucky to have found her 

She is ridiculous and non sense is very much applicable for her Dont know how to talk how to behave with the patient my problem also not resolved instead its a waste of moneypls dont visit her

We did not have good experience with this doctor She doesnt talk properly and doesnt give respect to patient even does not give proper answer to our query If we ask something 2 or more time then she scolds

Very good doctor I delivered my boy normally though there was a complication of baby passing stool  She handled it so confidently Very good healing hand she has

My twins were deliveted safely thanks to her A totally no non sense doctor who knows what she is doing

1 Extremely rude and always annoyed
2 Prescribed some medicine which caused severe constipation in 8 th week and later asked if i really prescribed it to you
