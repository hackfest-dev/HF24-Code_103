By far Dr Vijay Bose is the best surgeon in the world if you have hip problems Especially if youre young Not only is he a consummate professional Hes a really nice guy too Love you Dr Bose

I visited for difficult case for hip replacement revision sir  no one taken as challenge but Dr Bose sir proved that it is possible to do such  surgery I am really thank God for given such a good ortho surgeon  for leading rest of my life I really very thanks  for such a great miracle done in my life for walking again given hopes for my future life I recommend all over India for this doctor for ortho problems  every day  I remember and thankfull  to my god that Dr Bose sir

I had dual AVN for which I got operated for my left hip Before meeting dr Bose I visited 13 other doctors who had very different opinions some suggested to even operate my right leg which wasnt giving any problem at that time
After Meeting Dr Bose I was convinced to do surgery only for my left hip which was giving problem And now my left hip is completely pain free And under medication for my right hip Not many reputed doctors take their time and explain each an every single doubt One of the best doctors in the world A blessing to the medicine field Many can go through his online videos on YouTube and gain knowledge for own wellbeing

Thanks to Doctor Vijay Bose He has done my hip replacement surgery for AVN in SIMS hospital and I am recovering well now He is one of the best doctors in orthopaedics He is very responsible kind and sincere May God bless him ever

I got my right hip replacement done with doctor bose 6 years back He was the only doctor who assured me that I would return to a full active life with zero restrictions  zero issues I flew from Mumbai to Chennai to get the operation done I was walking the next day and was back home in Mumbai in 4 days Now I run jog swim play badminton do CrossFit without and problems now Dr Bose is a genius truly god sent I Highly recommend him

He performed hip joint replacement surgery on my mother back in 2002 and 2008 when I was a kid He is such a great human being Since my father was in Indian Air force and during operation we had some financial trouble he did not take his surgery charges just to assist us He is a great surgeon and great human being

Dr Vijay Bose is the best doctor for hip replacement  He had done my left hip replacement 10 years back in 2011 and i dont have any issue or pain in my left hip I can do my normal routine job very well Thank you doctor for all your support and making me fit   Now I am about to get my right hip replacment also from him
