I visited Dr Sarda after reading all the good reviews on Google 

I was travelling and had told her about the skin condition  it was a funhgal infection as per her analysis  I was going through  She did not even check the second infection on my stomach clearly stared at it from a distance and gave me medicines which I kept having as prescribed only to find that the fungal infection had spread way more and I am literally suffering since 6th Jan
I am the last person to come back and write a revie but this took toll on my health not just physical but also mental So please be extra careful to while getting yourself checked up by such doctors 

We all have Dermatology issues and we all know that like other health issues this is serious Other health issues are not visible to everyone but when it comes to skin it is visible and i will say at times embarrassing and also painful

I have had issues with my skin and when the first time i had issues my husband took me to a Miracle doctor He looked on the internet and we went I was not sure if that is going to help because i went to many doctors and never the issue was resolved And i wasted a lot of money

I met Dr Aarti Sarda 5 years back and till date if i have any issues or my friends or family have any issues i strictly ask them to go to her She is a Miracle doctor and i can absolutely say with zero doubt that all my issues were resolved in 1 go

She listens she understands and she cures you

I have many experiences with Dr Sarda with my friends and family which is exceptionally great When we had lockdown i had skin allergy and she cured me with 1 phone call and a picture which i sent her This is how well she knows what she is doing

In other words she is my godess when i need help I will always thank her and be grateful to her for all she is done for me

I feel for me and my close dear ones she is the number 1 doctor when it comes to any derma issues

Dr Aarti sarda is a very very good skin specialist and a very nice person had come in contact with her when my father in law was suffering from a skin disease and was hospitalized due to wrong medicines prescribed by a skin doctor and his condition was badshe really took very very good care of him and was always available whenever I contacted her and very sweetly responded to me after that I have always recommended her even in my family and to others she doesnt give too many medicines and very high doses only wat is requiredlistens very patiently and attends with a very smiling face always responds to messages and callsonce she wrote a medicine for my mother in law over the phone just with a description of wat she was suffering from and didnt even charge for it and it really helped her Shes a true professional with a very kind heart
 a very good and a beautiful doctor with a lovely charming smile
