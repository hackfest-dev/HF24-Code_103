We had the best experience with Dr Kalidutta Das for my mother in laws spine surgery at ISIC She had a accidental fall and suffered two vertrebral fractures in her back  She was in pain and advised rest for over 3 months hoping for a recovery with medications after consulting our local doctors but it only got worse And then Dr Das came as a ray of light in our lives as he promised a quick healing through surgery and assured us discharge in 34 days only Though sceptical and scared of surgery  we trusted him and he stood true to his words
Not only he did a fantastic job with the surgery but also provided us with endless moral support and personal care throughout the procedureIt all went so seamlessly Dr Das is humble and caring for his patients apart from being a deft spine surgeon which is a rare quality these days We walked home happy and satisfied with our experience at ISIC  Delhi All the staff were extremely supportive and cooperative too Thank you for everything  She is now able to walk properly and even do her daily chores well

Hey I am the sister of Rahul Kaushik who was under the specialized treatment and care of Dr Kalidutta Das renowned spine surgeon at ISIC
Thank you is not enough for him and his team My brother was going through tremendous lower back pain The doctor came to exact diagnosis and explained about the spinal surgical method and assured us of complete relief from day one of the procedure
Being convinced and skeptical at the same time we did consult two other specialists but vested our trust in Dr Das Now my brother is completely pain free as if it didnt exist
More than happy and satisfied that we chose Dr Das  Kudos to his dedicated and hardworking team
Steve needs a special mention in this regard
I highly recommend all who are facing any spinal issue to at least consult Dr Das once

Jayguru I would like to share some experience of my daughters treatment When we were coming to Delhi for girls treatment we were not getting any proper direction where to go to get proper treatment I write letters It was then that our Satsangs Venerable Acharyadev blessed us for treatment at the Spinal Injury Center I am personally happy and my wife is also happy Dr Kali Dutt Das who operated my daughter here performed the operation with sincerity Thanks to all his team for success

I have suffered a lot due to my spinal problems before I met Dr Kalidutta Das Indeed hes a living God in disguise a blessing for me Before I met him I was bedridden with unbearable back pain since a year which left me almost partially paralysed by my left leg My family were quite worried about my health so they took me to Indian Spinal injuries centre Delhi When Dr Das saw me he immediately diagnosed my problem and got me admitted in the Everest ward and I was opreated upon the very next day ie on 4th of July 2023
After that surgery miraculously I regained my health back and started walking again like before and all my back pain and discomforts were gone I feel so much relieved and feeling like reborn Today I can do everything that I earlier used to do I have no words to thank DrDas his team and Indian spinal injuries centre Delhi Whenever I visit Delhi I manage out time and make it sure to make a courtesy visit to Dr Das and the hospital because its because of him Im smiling today May Almighty God bless Dr Das in abundance with healthy and long life to serve people like us
