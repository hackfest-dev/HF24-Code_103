Wish I could rate him in negative I went to him few days back with my wife at AMRI Dhakuria Prior to that we had done FNAC test to ascertain if the problem is related to gland TB This doctor advised to go for a surgery which is a major one
Rather than following his advice blindly I paused the treatment process there and moved to Apollo Hospital Chennai

The doctor at Apollo said that he would try to treat the issue with medicine Because the surgery would be very very risky and life threatening So that is my experience with this  business minded doctor who cares only for the nursing home he works at and not the patient

My advice to this gentleman is that he should sit in a meat shop with a dagger in his hand rather than sitting in a doctors chair Because he is a butcher and not a doctor

Shame on him

My uncle diagnosed with cancer under treatment of Dr SNBasak since 2019 At first he was interested and behaved good with patient As my uncles age was not permit for surgery we depend on medication After 1year moreless treatment my uncle recovered completely Naturally he stated to depend on Dr SN Basak blindly He was too much obedient patient and always keep in touch with doctors Doctors suggest to do pet scan every year and my uncle did the same accordingly After Dec2022 problem raised again and my uncle went to doctor but he said report is good and there has no problem seen difficulties continued to increased In April23 Dr S N Basak admit that malignancy come back according to Pet scan report Dec2022 by then my uncles health had worsened We did not get any help and as well as guide from Dr SNBasak and his behavior was too rude and hopeless Everytime when my uncle went for check up he told  I have saved you 4 years you are not supposed to live this long Whatever we started treatment again under Dr S N Basak dated 12062023 we cant able to moving out from him as my uncle biased and trusted on him blindly My uncle discharged from hospital on 16062023 but there was no improvement and his health condition started getting worse on 23062023 my uncle went to Dr S N Basak for check up doctor told his patient my uncle directly that he will not survive further and advice to take mental preparation ask to complete all doings as he has no time I have never heard a doctor to tell a patient directly that heshe will not live long and nothing to do After that my uncle totally devastated with his word as he depends on him like GOD and passed away on 30062023   This is my humble request please think many times before go to Dr S N Basak for treatmentHe only knows money nothing else

We had a very disappointing experience with DR SAMINDRA NATH BASAK ultimately resulted in the loss of a dear relative I feel compelled to share my thoughts to ensure others are aware of the potential consequences

DR SAMINDRA NATH BASAK is extremely money minded unprofessional and at times downright rude Their focus on financial gain seemed to overshadow the quality of care provided

Regrettably the consequences of their unprofessional behavior led to dire consequences We feel let down by the medical system and believe that such behavior should not be tolerated within the field of healthcare

I strongly advise anyone seeking medical attention to carefully consider their options before choosing DR SAMINDRA NATH BASAK

He had treated my mother recently as she had to undergo Mastectomy operation He is highly skilled and experience which helped my mother for speedy recovery Moreover he is extremely humbled and answered all our quarries patiently and kept my mom motivated will the whole treatment procedure I am thankful to him for his swift diagnosis and treatmentWould recommend him anyone who come across this fearful disease

I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Dr SK Basak and I cannot express enough how disappointed and disheartened I am with the care provided by this socalled doctor My fathers battle with cancer took a devastating turn when we encountered Dr Basak who not only shattered our hopes but also displayed an appalling lack of compassion and professionalism throughout the entire ordeal

First and foremost Dr Basaks attitude was nothing short of rude and callous From the moment we stepped into his office he greeted us with a dismissive demeanor as if our concerns were insignificant and he had more important matters to attend to His cold and condescending behavior left us feeling like mere inconveniences rather than human beings desperately seeking guidance and support during a difficult time

But what truly sealed Dr Basaks reputation as the worst oncologist imaginable was his complete disregard for my fathers wellbeing Instead of providing hope empathy or even a shred of optimism he callously shattered any remaining positivity my father had left He delivered the news of my fathers prognosis in a cold and detached manner leaving us feeling utterly hopeless and defeated Rather than exploring treatment options or discussing potential avenues for support he swiftly dismissed any possibility of recovery leaving us in a state of shock and despair

To make matters worse it became painfully clear that Dr Basaks primary motivation was money not the wellbeing of his patients
In conclusion Dr SK Basak is an oncologist who should be avoided at all costs His rude and unprofessional demeanor lack of compassion and moneydriven approach make him utterly unsuited for the critical and sensitive field of oncology Our experience with him was nothing short of a nightmare and I would strongly advise anyone seeking quality care for themselves or their loved ones to steer clear of this doctor

I have met him first time in December 2022 Many more questions were in my mind before to discussBut seriously he was the only person who gave us strength to fight with such a atrocious disease  called CANCER I really appreciated his diagnosis and would like to recommend with my dear and near ones
Very well behaved and calm

Highly recommend him for his experience and expertise in the field of surgery His initial investigation and diagnosis for my Moms Mastectomy was spot on which helped mom to recover in no time She was on her normal diet within 12hrs of surgery and back home withing 4 days which was a sign of relief Am grateful  

Extremely rude and unprofessional doctorHe is not ready to give any guidance to his patients whenever we wanted to seek guidance from he he told us to come visit us in his chamber  will not provide guidance over phone
Do not ever visit him

Ruthless and inhuman Doctor who want to squeeze the money His attitude is not good When he sat in Sishu MANGAL hospital he ill treat my wife he tried  to do  biopsy of my wife by defective gun  but biopsy was not done inspite of putting gun inside the body and
he cause  injure to  my wife badly I have lodged specific complaint before Medical Council against him
My suggestion is to go to other doctors Beware of him

He is the worst doctor Ive ever met He is fraud liar and wants only money  Please dont trust him else youll lose your dear ones He doesnt care about his patients and infact he refused to treat his patients after surgery because he knows what he has done
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER
