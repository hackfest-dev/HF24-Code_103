Excellent customer service from making my first appointment I got best treatments regarding my skin concerns Doctor explained everything fully I was made to feel relaxed and welcomed as it was my first appointment I would definitely recommend

A very good dermatologist with rich experience I have been knowing him since last 22 years and he has always advised me to get better and have benefitted alot from his treatment  Even during COVID period he helped me with online consultations

He is horrible as a doctor He damaged my face twice I went to him back in 2018 That time he prescribed such bad sunscreen lotion and medicine that my face burned  and turned all black Then I had to go to another renowned skin specialist to fix my skinThis time also he did the same thing I was admitted at Kokilaben hospital for some other issuesThat time somehow my face turned red He came to visit me as a skin specialist Seeing him I got scared and even told him that he had damaged my skin before  Anyway this time he prescribed one steroid medicine but never told me to stop this medicine after one month Without knowing anything I continuously applied that medicine and got black spots on my face Last week I went to visit him he said I had to stop that medicine after one month Then he prescribed that same sunscreen lotion and medicine that made my face black again He made it like 1000 times worse And on top of that He has a lot of attitude He is the worst doctor in that renowned hospital Kokilaben hospital must take this matter very seriously

Im thankful he helped me diagnosed my allergies at early stage We did allergy test to understand which pollutants particle or food item is causing the damage Visited various dermatologist abroad but couldnt get solution elsewhere At first I was quite impatient to judge the results with the occurrence of frequent rashes but then gradually I could see great improvementJust followed the plan as suggested by the dr and it worked in my case

He might be a good doctor but no ethics how to speak with patients With my 70 plus old father he behaved very rudely and was too blunt to answer any questions If u want to insult urself then visit him

The most gentle doctor Ive ever come across

Extremely incompetent Is only interested in repeat consultations to get fees 2000 per consultation  Does not posses basic understanding of medicine

Worst doctor I have seen in my lifeNo experienceTotally money mindedvery bad surgical hand  and zero knowledgeGoogle does not give an option of negative rating otherwise rating him one star is also being too generous

Best doctor  and a kind and humble human being
May god bless him
