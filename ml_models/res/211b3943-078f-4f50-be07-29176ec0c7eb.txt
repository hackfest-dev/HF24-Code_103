Had to meet Dr Sejal Shah for my son untill I met her a lot of questions were running in my mind like will doctor have so much of time to hear y questions and answer all those Or just listen to what she says and come out the cabin quite

When she met my son doctor was soo polite and humble to understand the challenge that my son had and asked multiple questions to understand the situation better post which she listened to all the questions that me and my wife had the same was answered in detail

It was a great relief listening to her and the response that we got from her

Thanks Dr Sejal Shah for your patience and advice

Never the less i should  thank my friend Dr Anand Pedestrian for referring us to Dr Sejal Shah

Very experienced and polite doctor and staff They really made my 2 yr old daughter comfortable in order to get the tests done without her realising Their diagnosis was also quick and I really appreciate it
