Our experience with DrSumana was not good She scared us to take more test medicines and said babys health is not good However when we cross checked with other doc it was completely fine Her Response and guidance was not comforting to us Surely will not recommend her to anyone

Respected doctor
I was 12 years old  since then i have known you as you saved many of my family members and you have been my idol and my inspiration to become a doctor Since then I wanted to be a doctor and with your blessing i made it You are a blessing in my life  I love you for making the sacrifices youve made for putting the needs of others before the needs of yourself for dropping everything to come running when someone cries for help The world is so lucky you are in it  Love you doctor  You are the best

My wife took treatment from him
My wife had a laparoscopy last January for a cyst

He felt very comfortable in February but now he is in constant pain again

I dont know how to contact him online

It would be good to have his online contact number

I found him very patient friendly as a doctor

I wish him all the success

I have come in contact with Dr Sumana Manohar at Apollo cradle  Apollo Womens Hospital I found the doctor and her entire team to be very efficient rendering quick assistance pleasant to deal with and striving to give their utmost service in the best possible timeframe I highly recommend Dr Sumana Manohar to all the women who are looking to meet with a great Gynecologist Thumbs up and thank you Doctor

Dr Sumana Manohar maam is highly competent experienced and skilled OBGyn I went through Google reviews and her profile and chosen her as my doctor for my pregnancy journey I started consulting maam from week 9 at Apollo Womens Hospital Doctor took very good care of me and addressed all our queries and concerns diligently Finally I got admitted at week 39 at Apollo womens hospital and delivered healthy baby girl under Sumana Mams care Thanks to Sumana maam for my smooth pregnancy journey and delivery Special mention to Doctors assistants MsPriya and MsHarini for managing appointments efficiently

My experience with Dr Sumana Manohar was bad  I had visited her seeking treatment for endometriosis

Although I had recent blood reports and USG report She made me undergo a whole lot of unnecessary blood investigations and repeated the USG too

After which her treatment option was get married get pregnant and come back for delivery plus surgery of left ovary Her prescription was an analgesic for pain

Her poor knowledge that treatment of endometriosis is pregnancy was shocking to me
I was seeking treatment for pain and not fertility but I guess she makes more money by treating the latter hence she was so insistent

Forcing such opinions of getting married and conceiving as a treatment option and is called Medical Gaslighting Dont recommend her

Satisfied with my consultation with her She explains everything with patience and detail Would like to recommend Dr Sumana to everyone

Dr Sumana Manohar is highly approachable and very proficient  She is highly recommended by other patients and my personal experience with her has been excellent

She is an excellent doctor and her team in apollo was very cooperativeUnder Dr Sumana my wife undergone lap surgerywe need an online appointment to follow up the doctor we mailed at the email given prescription but no response from that endwhat need to do to get online appointment of Dr Sumana

We had an incredibly positive experience with Dr Sumana She helped us navigate IVF and the subsequent pregnancy She was kind honest and capable Not just Dr Sumana her entire team at both Suman Clinic and Apollo were incredibly kind and competentI would highly recommend Dr Sumana for fertility and pregnancy care
