Good doctor explains everything very well Satisfied Good hospital in ncr  Supportive staff Overall nice experience  

Dr Rajiv Setia is another god in form of doctor  He is ver experience doctor and calmly listen to the problem  Best thing about him is that in emergency if need any help he is available in odd times also one of the elder patient sitting in front of him  He dont want to attend his grandparent wedding but when dr asked him to join and call him at any time  While sharing his experience he was saying I attended the marriage and called 23 times but doctor never irritated and responsed very well He was also happy and for many elder patients he is like god  He give special care to elderly people  Thank god we have doctors like him in earth

I was admit in Asian Hospital under Dr Sethia
For stone problem as i had stone in Kidney

Had wrost experience in hospital and same as with Dr

At time of discharge Dr did not even suggest me for diet medicine even did not explain about treatment ie CT scan was done blood test and urine test at time of discharge

just formalities were done and I was charged 32k for only 4 hours

Also after 1 week im still suffering same stone problem

Dear Mr Setia if you remember correctly I was unhappy for this reason only that you were entertaining patients without any sequence on pretext that they just want to get confirmation of their meds Also would like to refresh your memory that your admin team itself accepted this and asked me to put it my complaint in writing Anyways I would just say God bless your patients

Dr sethia is realy very expirence  after meet him I come to know what is the EXPERIENCE

Literally pathetic experiencewasnt attending me properly Didnt give me anything beneficial either Not satisfied at all

Very good experience Very good Dr Helpfull Man
