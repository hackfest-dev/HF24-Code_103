Its been 6 years from my surgery now my knee feels as normal as before
Dr Gajjar took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure address any concerns I had and ensure I was comfortable throughout the entire process Their professionalism knowledge and skill instilled confidence in me from the start
The surgery itself was a success and Im grateful for Dr Gajjars precise work The recovery process has been smoother than I anticipated thanks to the thorough instructions and followup care provided by Dr Gajjar and their staff
Not only did they demonstrate outstanding surgical skill but they also showed genuine care and empathy for my wellbeing I felt supported every step of the way which made a significant difference in my recovery journey
Overall I highly recommend Dr Gajjar to anyone in need of knee ACL surgery or orthopedic care Their expertise professionalism and compassionate approach truly set them apart Thank you Dr Gajjar for helping me regain mobility and improving my quality of life

Im not the type to write review but was compelled to share my experience

I had a fall and was mis diagnosed by a very renowned and eminent orthopedic surgeon who advised 3 months physio Post the 3 month and feeling no relief I took a second opinion which to my absolute shock advised surgery due to ACL and LCL tear After doing further diligence we found Dr Gajjar to whom we went for a 3rd opinion

He too confirmed my worst fear that surgery was indeed imperative His examination was precise and he exuded so much confidence patience in explaining and listeningaddressing my anxiety I immediately knew that he would be the best at dealing with this multiple intervention know as the unhappy triad involving the ACL LCL and Miniscus

The surgery went ahead within a week of my visit in Feb 23 and the journey of recovery started thereafter under the watchful and concerned oversight by Dr Gajjar and his recommended team of physiotherapists

Dr Gajjar as he was on my first visit to him came across truly as an absolute professional very thorough in his skill and always keeping total healing as his primary goal He was never satisfied with me just being fine for him my achieving total flexibility and strength and nothing less was the singular and clarion objective

I cannot thank Dr Gajjar enough for not just being a great surgeon but an excellent human and for his dedication to the well being of those in his care

My mother had brain stroke on 20th January 2023 she got partial paralysed was all recovered by therapist then due to some mistake in righ shoulder movement she had rotator cuff muscles and other complication We did internet surfing and found Dr Shreyash Gajjar sir in Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital Andheri Mumbai  had consultation with him he is very kind behaviour is such that patient never feels insecure and uncomfortable to speak with him He made us understand the scenario all details pre and post operation of shoulder Arthroscopy and we followed it up her surgery was successful  his guidance made my mom come out of big trauma Now she is way to recovery with positive response Thankyou so much Dr Shreyash Gajjar your experience and knowledge is excellent you are not only good doctor but also good human being understands the situation

My father Ashokbhai J Diyora Age56 years underwent knee osteotomy surgery last year and I cannot express how grateful our family is to Dr Shreyash M Gajjar for the lifechanging transformation it brought about Before the surgery my father was plagued by chronic knee pain faced significant difficulties in walking and standing and his quality of life had greatly deteriorated However after the surgery performed by Dr Shreyash M Gajjar my fathers life has taken a remarkable turn for the better

From the very first consultation with Dr Shreyash M Gajjar we were impressed by his professionalism and expertise He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure its benefits and any potential risks ensuring that we felt wellinformed and at ease with the decision to proceed His compassionate and reassuring demeanor instilled confidence in our choice of surgeon

The surgery itself was a resounding success Dr Shreyash M Gajjar and his surgical team demonstrated exceptional skill and precision resulting in a seamless procedure Postsurgery my fathers recovery was closely monitored by Dr Shreyash M Gajjar and his dedicated medical staff which greatly contributed to a smooth and efficient rehabilitation processThe results have been nothing short of astonishing

Before the surgery my fathers knee pain made it nearly impossible for him to walk run or even bend his legs comfortably But now he is not only able to walk and stand without pain but has also regained the ability to run and bend his legs The transformation in his mobility and overall quality of life has been truly remarkable

Dr Shreyash M Gajjar goes above and beyond the call of duty He takes a personal interest in his patients wellbeing providing detailed postsurgery care instructions and ensuring that any concerns are promptly addressed His commitment to his patients recovery is evident and it has made all the difference in my fathers journey to better health

Dr shreyash gajjar  just like his name superb perfect one I have met in his field
He operated my both the shoulders2021 n 2022
Every shoulder pain is not always a frozen shoulder n who can know better than me N what I have learned is as follows
1 as mentioned above all shoulder pains r not frozen shoulder it can be muscle tear too which only a specialist can know n cure
2 besides bones and joints there r muscles tendons rotator cuff and much more which can give u problems and pains
3 each one has a separate specialist ortho to look after i e A general orthopedic for bones related issues and a sports orthopedic for muscles tendons etc etc which is DR SHREYASH GAJJAR
4 bones related issues r detected in Xrays n muscles related issues r detected in MRI so when ur pain is not detected in xrays please spend a little more n get a clear conclusion about ur issue and go to a specialist for that Particular problem instead of suppressing ur pain with pain killers n steroids
Ur muscle n tendons can be damaged or tear bcz they might b weak or bcz of exertion like heavy work or heavy exercise etc etc
Ur muscles can b weak by any reason and give u trouble
It can b bcoz of not proper nutrtion or age or other physical aliments hard work or heavy work etc etc

Just b aware about ur issue and find a perfect specialist for ur particular issue

Thanks doctor gajjar and his teamfor everything

I had parameniscal cyst and and partial lateral meniscus tear It troubled me a lot to walk and running was near impossible I came to India from Bangladesh  in search of better treatment So i saw a couple of wellknown doctors here but with all honesty the talk with Dr Shreyash M Gajjar made me more confident and feel at ease He told me to get an arthroscopic surgery after which my leg would be better than ever and Ill be able to play all sports comfortably again He did my surgery and gave me instructions to follow for the next few months to heal and get my strength back Id say im almost there just need to gain strength by doing exercises that he instructed In my opinion he is one of the most helpful and forthcoming doctors ever He is truly one of the best at what he does And its not just him but his assistant Dr Nilesh was of great help Their service is unmatched Im very satisfied with the treatment i received from Dr Shreyash M Gajjar and the service from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital

I have undergone an operation for knee and the bestest doctor in my life i could get is dr shreyash gajjar nothing is impossible for him

Dr Gajjar operated my mother for a meniscus tear in both her knees He had initially explained everything in detail and told us that post the surgery mom will be free of pain and that is what happened She got relieved of the excruciating pain she was facing plus her arthritis got better too
Really grateful for Sir Hes extremely polite and the best in whatever he does He will understand your issue and answer them very patiently
