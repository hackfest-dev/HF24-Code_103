Surgery of my mother was done by Dr Sameer kaul  he had satisfied that in future the disease will not come back Hope for the best

Good experience with Dr Sameer kaul My treatment is going immunotherapy under Dr Kaul He is god for me

Good experience with the Doctor Dr Sameer Kaul was very kind  professional during patient treatment

People say he is one of the finest oncologists in India but he is not he will never take ownership throughout the treatment once the case is out of his control he will say you should take the patient back to your home when you go to him for the first time he will give you 100 percent assurance but once you start the treatment he will not take any ownership

Very capable  understanding as per the line of treatment He really takes care of his patients Cant find such a good Doctor who treats you like a family member  is very polite  cordial I have 2 experience with him One for my friend rahul and second one for my mother

                          

An absolute scam of a doctor who is only in it for the money Will take on any case and then quickly kick the patient to the curb once all the tests are done and money has been spent Please avoid the grief and pain that is associated with Sameer Kaul and go to ANY other doctor

Dr Sameer Kaul sir is a very experienced senior doctor we got great references from one of our known friends He is very patient  attentive listener and always does what is best for the patient My mothers surgery was done by him recently and it was a success He is saving lives and there is no greater good deed than this in life I would surely 100 recommend sameer kaul sir to anyone Regards Vipul Dhingra

Dr Sameer Kaul is renowned cancer specialist and of great repute  We are very happy and satisfied with his treatment  His diagnosis has been a great importance and helpful for us  We wish him all the best  With our greatest regards to Dr Sameer Kaul
