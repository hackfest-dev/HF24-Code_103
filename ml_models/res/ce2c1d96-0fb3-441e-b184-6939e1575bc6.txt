Vanish and muskan are most poor attendants
Highly favourable to their family members

I was standing right there in que for 1 hours
But his uncle friends come and  she was right there to favour them for a fast speedy entry without any wait

Highly in professional Doctor staff

Doctor does not listen to the issues of patients Makes quick diagnosis without having any background of the issue highly do not recommend Please dont waste your money on this doctor

A very rude doctor He had no idea about the problem that my mother was facing and gave all wrong medicines which further increased her problem
He is

He has no expertise in diagnosing the problem and has given illogical and harmful medicines that also wasnt the problem that my wife actually did had He is a shrud guy and egoistic with no sense of talking to his staff tooWill not recommend him for any treatment

Very rude dr in the world
He has no idea to talk with patients those are suffering with anxiety
He doesnt listen patients valuable points
I think he should focus on good communication skills

He is the WORST doctor ever with rude behaviour Very expensive and talked only for 2 minutes Dont waste your time and money on this doctor

He should work on his diagnosis and empathy towards patients Highly unrecommended

Dr Arun garg and junior doctor dr Mithlesh in neuroscience Both are very worst doctor in the world Arun garg is very rudand irresponsibleI think junior doctor mithlesh is illetrat person

Dr is very rude and arrogant No way of talking Do want to listen  discuss your problems only suggest will give you injection  surgery only solution  Same problem is cure with exercise only

he is most experienced doctoru can believe on him blindly
