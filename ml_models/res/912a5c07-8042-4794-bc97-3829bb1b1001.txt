Worlds worst doctor and clinic
I strongly recommend everyone not to go to this worst clinic
Because except saying surgery they will not leave any patient
I went there for fissures problem which is at very initial stage which can be cured with medicines and home remedies
But he said to go for laser surgery
I have mediclaim so they said we will do it for free
But I refused for laser surgery
So doctor and nurse started continuously calling me with different different nos daily and forced me for laser surgery and tried different ways to convince me
They are frauds
They are only working for money
They are misusing this profession

Experienced doctor however did not discuss all the options and directly recommended the Surgery I felt like he was Locking me into the surgery deal by providing the post surgery pills on the Initial day of consultation Didnt fully explain what the surgery will do the body kept saying a simple surgery but as patient I felt I should know what is happening to your body before you commit

Best doctor for  piles and he is very friendly and kind
