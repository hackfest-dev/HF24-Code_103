Dr Archana mam is one of the finest doctor in Navimumbai She is very much polite gentle and trustworthy It was new for us and we went with Dr Archana mam believe me we can blindly trust and rely on her She kept my wife maternity process very simple with only required medicines and tests
Please do have issue with staff but believe me once you meet dr madam all will go away I would highly recommend dr archana wani mam to go and see for pregnancy

Doctors are good but receptionist n other some nurses are very bad there is no proper communication if u go first time we dont hav idea n when we ask for something they dont reply properly

Dr Archana is the best she is one genuine Doctor I have seen in a life time

Dr Archana wani is very kind and knowledgeable doctor she personally takes care of patient

Staff is very careless and all mavshi are asking for gift bakshish after dilivery  if we ignore them they will do the same very bad behaviour  overall Dr Archana Wani is best doctor but other doctor are not that much good in behaviour

receptionist staff is very rude i was in emergency situationthen also she dont helps me

Staff is rude
No appointment system
you have to be in queue for longer than 3 hours with no place to sit

Staff is so rude and impolite  for past 1 month I have been trying  to get an appointment  but staff always says all the slots are full and I must say the way of staff handling  patients and their relatives they truly dont  deserve to be at a novel profession as medical
