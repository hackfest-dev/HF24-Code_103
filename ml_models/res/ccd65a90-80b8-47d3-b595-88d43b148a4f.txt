We were really tensed when my husband was diagnosed with Acute Subdural Hematoma There wasnt much time left and immediate surgical intervention was needed Dr Sudheer not only took his case at the last minute but also reassured us that there would be no complications and he would get well soon Today we went for our final consultation after 5 months his CT scan came completely free of any abnormality and we are free of all worries now Dr Sudheer is extremely down to earth for a doctor of his stature and he is one of the best out there He does not just save people he saves families 

I would like to share our experience with Dr Sudheer kumar tyagi and his team at Apollo hospital delhi First of all I would like to thank Dr Sudheer for providing an exceptional medical treatment to cure my Fathers ailment He is very polite calm and patiently listen the patients problem
I would recommend him to all those who may need his consultation

A friendly behviour doctor with whom you can consult each and every issue and he will elaborate it to you My brother was under his diagnosis for severe headache now he is totally fine and I am fully satisfied with all the process I am happy that I came herebut there is always a chance to improve
