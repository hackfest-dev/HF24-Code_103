Worst Doctor I have ever seen Degrees are just a piece of paper real education seen in behaviour He doesnt care about patients time he doesnt have any kind of commitment Patients need to wait for long time while he was busy in phone 

Dr Dhiman Kahali sir is an exceptional healthcare professional who goes above and beyond in providing compassionate and expert care Their profound knowledge attentive approach and commitment to patient wellbeing create an environment 

If I could have given ratings in minus

This is an old man in a hurry 

Such a worst Dr Dont hear patients symptoms or problem clearly and doesnt touch physicaly to know well Stright he is a commercial person knows well how to make profit and pick money from pocket

First I would like to thank Dr Dhiman Kahali   He is one of the best interventional cardiologist  Coronary Angioplasty Surgeons not only in India but also in Asia  Last Tuesday I was in dire straits  I took my brother to the hospital 

Very kind polite and cooperative I visited him for my father and he is surely one of the best in his business

One of the best cardio doctors my father showed him 10 years ago with 30 blockage and now he is absolutely fine with just medicine and no further increase in blockage

I had the worst experience with him yesterday First of all we waited for 2 hours beyond our scheduled appointment time Even if this was still acceptable because of his tight schedule his behavior left us very diappointed He doesnt 

Ive had a great experience with Dr Kahali He treats the patients with lots of passion and compassion Hence I express my greatest thanks and appreciation for the attention he has provided and treated me Would definitely recommend him  

May be too highly qualified It doesnt matter More a businessman than a doc He seems tobe  prone to advise invasive cardiac examination than non invasive ones He scarcely listens to the patient focus on the fulfillment of his own
