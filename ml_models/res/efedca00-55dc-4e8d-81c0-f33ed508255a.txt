When i was visited Dr Ravi Bhatia at Sarvodaya Hospital Sec 8 Faridabad He was busy with one of his lady friend in his cabin and chatting from last more than 1 hr in OPD timings All the patients are waiting eagerly when Dr will finished his personal chat and start to see them This time is dedicated only for patient and they have paid for this And the beauty is Dr does not bother about this and shows no respect of others time I rate him zero and not recommended for treatment

Mein ne apni Bibi ka operation sarvodaya hospital mein Dr Ravi sir se krwaya Jo ki bahut hi acha hua hai or bimari bhi thik ho gyi hai mein bhaut khush hu
