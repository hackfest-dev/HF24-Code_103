Dr SVSS prasad and Dr Srinath took care of chemo cycle for my mother last year with out any issues They were very friendly and helpful during the entire process Dr Prasad has the ability to reassure the patient with his communication Met him with a sense of fear about possible side affects of Chemotherapy but felt relaxed after talking to him for few minutes

My mom Indra was treated by Dr Prasad and his team My mom has been very comfortable with the doctor and we admire him a lot  Sir not only treated her as a patient  but considering her age he always tried to understand my moms perspective  remained patient  highly responsive through out the treatment  and always listened to her concerns empathetically which is what we all need from an EXCELLENT doctor

Prasad sirs team Dr Srinath and Dr Sharief have always been cooperative and highly responsive to us From Day 1 of the treatment onwards  both of them were very cooperative and by now we find a room of comfort with both of them

Great work by this team and good luck for future 

I believe that I hv received the highest quality care from Dr Svss Prasad From my first day of planning to my last session everything was perfect
I feel extremely fortunate and lucky to have been a patient with him n I believe that I have received the highest quality care
In addition to saving my life he was always kind and compassionate to me I always be grateful to him
He had listened to me spent time with me and made me feel like I was only his patient I applaud him and thank him Bcaz he made a difference in my life I look forward to my next chapter

The team of Dr Prasad Sir and Dr Srikanth at Apollo Cancer Institute in Hyderabad is the best medical oncologist pair that one can ask for in my opinion They are first and foremost compassionate toward the patient They made my dad feel comfortable with the treatment and options and gave personal attention and care from the onset of the treatment I brought my dad for a second opinion to Hyderabad after no so good prognosis and options in Vizag Ever since the treatment started they monitored him closely and were always responsive to my WhatsApp messages asking about side affects  during his treatment I felt that was very important to us as we didnt have to scramble in the middle of the night to find a doctor if my dad had nausea or vomiting or any of the several side effects that can happen during chemotherapy

The treatment gave us better than expected results in my dads case and we are very happy with the progression so far All thanks to God first and foremost and then the incredible work by Dr Prasad and Dr Srinath
