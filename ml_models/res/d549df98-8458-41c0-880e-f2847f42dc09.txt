I recently went to Apollo hospital Chennai and met with Dr Robert Mao His utmost caring and fatherly behaviour made us feel full confident and my husbands Angioplasty has been successfully done by Sir Dr Mao We are really lucky to get into contact with him at the right moment
God bless you Sir 

what I love about Dr Mao is his dedication towards his patient and his politeness towards everyone

Dr Robert Mao one of the wonderful man I have ever met So humble and polite The fatherly attitude of this wonderful doctor could bring life to his patients I will always remember you sir May god bless you long and healthy life

Dr Robert Mao is not just a Doctor but a GOD for many My mother was his patient in the year 1999 She had a hole in her heart and she underwent an open heart surgery at Apollo 22 years have passed and she is all healthy fit and fine
His personal attention and affectionate smile towards his patients makes them forget their ailments  Thank you sir for your service

Dr robert mao is just a cardiologist and not a cardiac surgeonas a result he does not do bypass surgery or open heartbut apollo is such a fraud that they dont disclose untill you ask personallythe surgery is done by some other doctors whose name they dont even disclosethey get the patient admitted under dr robert mao and take the lumps some money and then finally the surgery is done by some person whose name u dont even come to knowsuddenly before the operation the discloseand if u ask the doctor to refer surgeon as per ypur choice thr cost gets too highapollo also fraudelents by charging extra money by giving false justifications in the bill and that extea amount needs to be paid before discharging

A wonderful doctor very thorough approachable and accurate in his diagnosis He patiently answered all my questions and explained the diagnosis and treatment at length We need more doctors like him 

One of the best doctor i ever seen I am saluting to his dedication and  honesty towards his job Great doctor He used to seat for the OPD patient  till 1 to 2 AM and the OPD timing is there in hospital 9 to 6 PM So  dont worry about timing till what time he will seat for OPD patient If you are in a Q then definitely he will seat and check the patient

Bohot acha doctor ha

One of best caridiologist ever May god bless you sir 

Robert Mao is a very polite person and his behaviour is wonderful and the best doctor I have seen in my life
