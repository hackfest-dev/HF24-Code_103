Truly an Angel

Visited Dr Percy at HNReliance Hospital after consulting 2 leading Drs In Mumbais top hospitals with a friends reference
I fail to understand how can someone give negative feedbacks as seen on social websites

He is the most down to earth and genuine urologist one can find I had been diagnosed with kidney stones and had to get them removed He was very clear in diagnosis and treatment plan during the consultation itself Had no second thoughts  that he is going to be my treating Dr

On admission he and his team Dr Annirudh Desai took good care and made sure I stay calm before and after the procedure RIRS was performed which was very mush successful i believe as I did not encounter any severe post operative pain or discomfort even with the stent in place

Removal of Stent was even smoother and matter of seconds was completed under LA

He epitomises a perfect surgeon and moreso a nobel Human being

Dont get influenced by his years of experience and picture above He is as young and energetic as a 50 year old man

Will highly recommend him

Dr Chibber is excellent doctor But use him for diagnosis and initial treatment I had twice experienced he suggesting operation which was not best for the patient Beware of hospital and doctors personal agenda and take 2nd opinion before committing to procedures

Horrible attitude Im shocked that a doctor can have such a rude  careless demeanour  He def is one doctor who should be avoided at all cost

Only he cheak tha report who test by them doctor charge 2000 ruppys and without no give me a any cleryfication of my report and he walk out from opd very careless person he is a

Went three time  Without any clarity said take Doxy tablet Please dont go Careless person

Most horrible and greedy doctor has a bad reputation please dont consult him
