First of all I would like to pay my heartiest thanks to Mr Vipeen for his outstanding and incredible work from starting till end
The whole process was very smooth and hassle free 

Initially I was hesitating to take service  but vipeen explained very well Then I agreed and consulting Dr Manu bora for my ACL and Meniscus Issues 
Dr Manu bora one of best surgeon  Well Experienced and Calm Doctor  listened me very well and guided my like a brother and talked me like a friend

First Step succeed as I got believed from Doctors Side 
 as when you are going for surgery then Most Important part is Surgeon 

Secondly I went to Hospital with a hesitation for Admission where I met to Mr Abhishek  Hospital Care buddy and he  cleared my all doubts and I got admitted smoothly Hospital Care Buddy Mr Abhishek was always available on call or to meet whenever you need anything

Thirdly the Hospital and Nurse Department were also good caring and making all process smoothly  but remember if you are going through Pristyn Care then dont make more expectations from Hospital side  if you need anything then just contact to your Hospital Care buddy  he will solve all your problems through Hospital

Fourth  Food For Attended  Everyday in cashless system  or  Packages in Cash mode  on timely  cab for pickup and drop up  post surgery Physiotherapy is very smooth and clear process from pristyne care

Fifth  Apart from Hospital Care buddy  Pristyn care also provide you a Pristyn care assistance like in My Case Mr Yuvraj  Aarav  he also care for every things 

Overall surgery went very smoothly and got discharged without a single problem

So overall
In this very busy life  if you are getting some support from anywhere else during hospitalisation process makes you  to feel relax and tens free 

Reached Home safely now  will definitely visit to Dr for post care and Pristyn care will also help if anything else require from my side 

Overall 
Surgery Means Pristyn Care
If you need an extra care and attention and want smooth and hassle free Admission and Discharge then chose Pristyn Care

Giving one star only because you need to give a star to put in a review
The doctor is super egoistic no professionalism whatsoever Theres no system at the client He attends to a minimum of 3 patients at the same time which is not ETHICAL
Second HE DOES NOT RESPECT HIS PATIENTS
Third he thinks he is the God of Sports Medicine

We get that he has grown on social media because of his content but that content does not align with his personality He literally disrespected an army man by saying that you dont have enough funds to get an operation done by me

The staff is also very very arrogant  egoistic

I would highly recommend please do not visit here if youve known him from social media
We fell in the trap I am saving you a lot of trouble

Dr Bora treated my mother and mother in law for knee and shoulder pain respectivelyBoth were advised surgery by other hospitals but with Dr Boras treatment both are doing good without surgery One of the best things about Dr Bora is he genuinely cares about his patients and advises what is best for them

Best doctor with best backend team for billing and rest of the supports like TPA n all for this Thanks Vipin Ji
Dr Manu Sir r an expert in this field Thanks for giving me a new start sir
Thanks for physio team also especially Dr Mansi

First of all I would like to salute Dr Manu Bora
Because his working schedule is very good
And the patient or any local or candidate from any state is the best way to talk to them
And meeting the head gave me a lot of peace
Thank you sir and all members

I had my right knee Grade 3 ACL  Medial meniscus tear I stay in Mumbai and consulted many orthopaedic doctors but wasnt satisfied with consulting at last after research of many YouTube videosGoogle reviews I met Dr Manu Bora and finally decided to undergo surgery from him and done with my operation  Dr Manu Bora explained me very well in detail about the operation  I received a great support from DrManu Bora Team specially speaking about Mr Sujeet He guided me since consulting to complete operation procedure and was continuously in follow up post surgery also he supported me very well in mediclaim As of now I am on rest period due to No knee bending for some time due to meniscus surgery Will share my further feedback about the operation treatment and result soon

Thank You Dr Manu Bora  Team

This was my worst experience so far while visiting a doctor I was the second patient to arrive and I got a chance to see the doctor after 25 hours as patients were called randomly and when I went to see the doctor he did not physically examine my shoulder and neck as I was experiencing severe pain or listen to my problem

I highly recommend Dr Manu Bora for their exceptional medical expertise and caring demeanor From my first appointment it was evident that Mr Sujeet genuinely cares about their patients and goes above and beyond to provide comprehensive care
He took the time to listen attentively to my concerns thoroughly explain diagnoses and treatment options and answer any questions I had in a way that was easy to understand

Overall he helped in each and every manner during the course of my surgery
