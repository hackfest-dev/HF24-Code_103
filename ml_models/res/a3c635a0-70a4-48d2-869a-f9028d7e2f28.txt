Not a good experience way too expensive medicines suggested by him for heavy commissions The medicines that he prescribed me for a period of 15 months costed me 7k which is too much The behaviour of the doctor was also not upto mark I got fooled as I visited the place for the first and the last time that day now I understood that he does it for commission Being a doctor was once a noble profession but today its just about business especially by doctors like him

So I ahve been going to him for about 8 months I have been having dermititis for last 3 yrs tried various doctors but he was not at all worthy I had got biopsy done twice before coming to him and he asked me to get it done again I still went for it hoping to find something The results came in 4 days and my visit would have been free but still he called me after 7 days asking to repeat same medsjust to mint some extra  money He keeps pushing to get medicines from the pharmacy outside the hospital to get commissions Even for simple medicines like omega 369  he would write medicines of very 3rd grade companies Dont know why Gangaram has made him the HOD Should be sacked immediately

He was rude I believe that medical practitioners like him who cant control their behaviour and demeanour to patients should be thrown out of the medical profession A doctor needs to be civil My appointment with him turned out to be him shouting and abusing other patients including me As a patient I would hate to be under him He needs a lesson in the Hippocrates oath and how above all he needs to learn how to be humble and pleasant I left his treatment as he was obnoxious and instead sought another dermatologist

Right I also found the same its only business motive with 0 cure nothing else dont recommend anyone Else choice is yours

He is rude and arrogant and the problem for which we went for he did not prescribe medicines for that problem
Also he writes extremely costly medicines and pushes the patient to buy it from certain shops only The medicines which he prescribes is not available anywhere else

Maine kitni bar visit kiya aur kai month tak medicine bhi liya but not batter result mila face ke pimples nhi khatam kar paye Dr Sahab presan ho ke Maine treatment bich me hi rok diya totally paisa waste ho gya mera

He recommended local medicine  price range is too high Same salt reputed company medicine available in 80 less  rates

Dr Heavy commission including in all the local medicine

Fraud Doctor
Dont ever visit to this doctor He just suggests biopsy for even allergy Bakwaas

Worst doctor he is just making the busines result are about nil or zero plz dont consult this doctor for your own sake

The receptionist at this clinic has no manners whatsoever He dosent know how to talk to any patient and was very rude Zero star for staff because i couldnt get the appointment thanks to receptionist and cannot comment how the doctor is
