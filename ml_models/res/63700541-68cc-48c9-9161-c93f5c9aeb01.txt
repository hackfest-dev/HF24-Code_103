I suggest not to consult with him no proper explanation only he gives prescription he leaves the patient in doubt he doesnt give any clarification to patient

Frankly speaking the doctor is gem and he has huge understanding about disease but the only issue I feel with him he doesnt give extra suggestions wrt what else a patient to take care
A doctor must be a friend to patient and he should always advise what else needs to be done apart from taking medications

Doctor badly treat present not consultant properly

Best nephrologist

Very great dr

The best doctor deserves thanks and appreciation He saved our son after God Almighty
