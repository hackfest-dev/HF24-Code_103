Dr Anil Monga sir is the best doctor by skills  nature behaviour and have down to earth behaviour Here are my experience about him 
1 He is a highly skilled doctor with 40 years of experience and a senior consultant in Sir ganga ram hospital 
2 He treated my 3yearold son as his grandson In my case he visited about 7 times in my room and helped me in feeding my child after surgery
3After surgery patients are discharged same day but as i came from aligarh he even managed a stay in his hospital for 2 days
4 Charged only a reasonable price for surgery in my case its adenotonsillectomy
5 Very downtoearth behaviour visit him with a proper appointment
6 I approached several doctor  for my son medical condition but all have the same type of attitude of ignoring patient queries but dr anil monga will listen you properly and treated you by best way
7 His son Uday monga is also have nice behaviour and listen you properly for your queries 



My Tonsillectomy and Saptoplasty surgery was successfully done by Dr Monga and their staff All the staff members was generous and very kind I remember that day after the surgery all the doctors Dr Uday  Dr Monga and each of staff members met me and their post operative care is good Thanks a lot to all of you

I dont understand why and how people said that he is money minded and rude or whatever I went to his house cum clinic today ie 30th September 2022 around 515 and saw him attending to elderly patients with utmost care We can hear him conversating with patients always When my turn came I went inside and literally I got my problem cured in approximately 120 Seconds max and relieved now I can share his prescription too wherein he said No Medicine required all well It was a beautiful experience indeed God Bless such a sweet angel like him During corona we used to call them warriors and angels and now people are writing different reviews It happens

Doctor is very money minded He will immediately recommend surgery for minor problems even in case of children He will write a number of test to be done maybe to earn a lot of money from diagnostic centres

Excellent doc in Delhi
I have never seen doc like him  He is the best

O
Worst doctor ever  he oprated my nose and thiroglosal duct nothing has been changed it is the same even after oprating and when we ask this  about it  he simply say we can do the surgry again
I highly recomend every one to never  go their  He is verybad doctor he will ruin yoir case

The only clinic i felt safe to goto in a covid situation Fully PPE kit equiped staff with minimum contact with the patient  and frequent sanitization of the place 

Dr Anil Kumar Monga is the best doctor
