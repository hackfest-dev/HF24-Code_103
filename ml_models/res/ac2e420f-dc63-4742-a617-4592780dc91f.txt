He is the most greedy and unprofessional doctor I have seen My wife had just grade 1 fatty liver after the birth of my son as she has ICP during pregnancy I dont know why he force everybody for fibroscan He just gave himself every award and always bragging about his thesis about stages of liver cancer in Argentina Selling generic medicine on very high cost I will never visit him and advice anyone to go This is my opinion totally

Dr ravindra pal singh is probably the best GI surgeon in Delhi NCR
