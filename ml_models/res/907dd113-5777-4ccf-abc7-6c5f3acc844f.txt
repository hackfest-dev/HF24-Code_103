God cannot be everywhere Thats why he has sent angels like Dr Hari Goyal When in 2021 my mother was diagnosed with stage 2 disease our whole family went about frantically consulting all big hospitals without getting any hope of an assured line of treatment I am all praise for Dr Hari when we finally consulted him Not only did he with his deep knowledge of the ailment and prognosis  successfully treated my Mothers serious condition by  minimal oral medication he continuously kept on encouraging her to beat all the odds and come out of a life threatening condition which was totally unbelievable for the entire family God bless him  we pray our country keeps on producing more such able and kind doctors who treat and bring smiles to his patients and family as if they are his own family members

Doctor is good and helping everywhere but the treatment approach is not good Not instructing his juniors and not consulting with his colleagues during treatment of a patient We wasted more than one month due to Dr Hari Goyal

One of the best Doctor I have seen in my life Very experienced soft spoken humble He can go to any extent to treat his patients God bless him

Very caring listen to the patient very attentively soft spoken dedicated professional Gem of a doctor and very good human being My wife was treated under his care  Regards Dr Goyal sir

I have been undergoing treatment of multiple myeloma by Dr Hari Goyal since september 2019 I have yet to come accross a doctor who is ever smiling and extremely patient with all patients God bless him to save and treat as many patients as possible A gem of a person and an amazing doctor

Im glad I met Dr Hari Goyal for my fathers treatment  Hes a very jovial doctor and puts his patients at ease Hes sensitive and cares a lot for his patients He has a soft and caring approach towards the treatment of his patients My father developed a liking for him and trusts him blindly For us he is the best Oncologist God bless him

He is the best doctor for OncologyVery Positive Treats patients like his own family membersmay God give him all the happiness in the world and a long long life to serve the people

I have not seen a better doctor than Dr Hari Goyal he is truly God sent who gives so much positivity to the patients and their attendants Most importantly he will guide you with what is best for you as patient and will spend enough time to comfort you with explanation of why it is the best course unlike other doctors who are target driven May God give you continued strength health and long life so that you keep empowering the patients with health and positivity like you always do Regards
