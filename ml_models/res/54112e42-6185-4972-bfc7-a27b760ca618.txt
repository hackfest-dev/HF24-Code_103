Dr Rafat was a life saver for us Our 4 year old daughter was suffering from severe leg pain She was limping and was on 247 painkillers Couldnt attend school properly Each time the pain killers started to wear off she was in severe pain All other doctors we saw were ignoring it as growing pains Dr Rafat was the only doctor who wouldnt give up on our daughter She ensured the right tests happened And the problem was diagnosed She read up on new medical areas and found the right connections across her network And helped to correctly diagnose that our daughter had a tumor in her leg Thankfully it turned out to be a benign tumor and removing it though surgery helped to address the pain Were incredibly thankful to Dr Rafat Shes one of the best doctors we know

She did a very good treatment my son kanha I think he has a mental problem she is managing it since last three years now he is much better than before she is very caring thank you Dr Rafat

Had really great sessions with her for my son Her prognosis is very good It was a very pleasant and satisfying experience consulting with doctor She listens all our problems and opinions with patience She explains the treatment protocols in details to the parents

Dr Rafat is such a nice person and gives a clear feedback to the parent Gives adequate time listens to all the points from parent Even asks certain things which a parent may not normally may not note usually
She gives full attention and even listens to minute  things
I as a parent would highly recommend Dr Rafat

Truly satisfied and appreciated the behavior of the Doctor and the way she is treating my child  I can see a lot of development and would recommend her anytime to the parents who need her help God bless you  Doctor
