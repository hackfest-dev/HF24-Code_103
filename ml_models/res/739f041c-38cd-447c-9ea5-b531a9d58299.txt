Two star for the doctor only but the treatment is very expensive 5000 for shared room that is also very dirty they changed single rooms to sharing rooms Very small room and disturbing People sleeping on corridorsteps and landings No one care One duty sister and she is also with not much experience First u need to pay 500 for consultation doctor will not prescribes any thing just he write admit U need to pay 10000 advance and again 500 for registration And general wards are horrible If u want to discharge doctor words are sign and go we are not responsible Very cheap mentality money making business For OP consultation come if u have lots of time and money If u dont have rooms and staff why u want to fill more patients Just one request renovate ur hospital Put proper staff

Worst experience ever

Dont visit this hospital and Dont wste your money

Please visit this doctor for kids he is very humble and good doctor You can find Doctor with integrity here Daily from morning 10 to 1 and 6 to 8 he attends patients Doctor is too good and fee is reasonable

Be patient while attending doctor poor and rich do come here For kids in illness  please visit this doctor

He got so much of experience for x ray and blood test available here he watches by evening and gives medication

Please visit this doctor from kid infant days

I visited this doctor since my kid 6 months and now he is 14 still we visit this doctor for my 2 kids 14 and 16 ages

Good doctor he have enough knowledge about kids never recommend more medicines and unnecessary medicineplenty experience he speaks good with children to know problems properly  but consultation fee Rs 500 is big amount and not reasonable

Omar musse underwent surgery for cancer foot in Kenya
Came here with non healing wounds which are infected
Dr sugunakar Reddy took good care did surgery with amazing result
Wound healed in 2 weeks time
He also arranged for symes prosthesis
Patient able to walk happily with the leg normally weare very happy with the hospital services and billing also

He is a very Good doctor hears all the patients problems answers with very much patience and we can always see a smile on his facei strongly suggest he is a very very gud doctor

These guys are too commercial and they dont even care of the patient unless you pay them money even in emergency Recent experience what we had is the doctor did not even touch my daughter when she was suffering from fits We requested them that it only needs 5 to 10 mins to pay them money and in the meanwhile requested them to start treatment But in vein I dont recommend them at all at any cost When it comes to hygiene of the rooms I would rather rate them ZERO and charges are also too high The buckets in the rooms were sticky and wacky And to my surprise how come they got 32 rating God only knows

Be careful  just take prescription and leave do not admit ur kid  I have admitted my kid and its called 0 maintainence staff and hospitality  the security becomes nurse and the nurse is on 247 tiktok  doctor writes to admit and does basic treatment only Very unprofessional commercial hospital

I had a very bad experience with the Dr Sugunakar Reddy I took my 3 year  old daughter to him but without any proper evaluation he suggested me to admit my daughter Their motive is to fill the rooms in the hospital no matter it is required for the patient to admit in the hospital or not I suspected that and took my daughter to different hospital where they diagnosed her fever with a couple of medicines Adding to this plight their maintenance of the hospital is pathetic no proper ventilation and have to wait for hours though we have  a scheduled appointment Please take more money if you want but my humble is request not to suggest to admit in hospital when it is not needed and dont make patients life  miserable
