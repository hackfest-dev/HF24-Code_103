Sarojini mam such a careful doctor to me she seems like a mother who care for her patient just like a mother does for her child She carefully went through all my previous illness history and diagnosed the illness that I am having in my body I am taking her medicines now I am more than satisfied to get her as my doctor

Last year I have been visited in Appollo Hospital since I was diagnosed with gall stone Dr Sarojini Parmeshwaran helped me out with the clarification of my gall stone and have prescribed the required medicines and tests Her speaking style is so nice that patients experience less stress and are able to recover from any type of strain

She is just amazing Her behaviour towards patient is just awesome She is too much caring Adorable Love you mam You are the best

Excellent doctor I consulted her online for my mother and she was able to provide us the right guidance

Good Absrve
