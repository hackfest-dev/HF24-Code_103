He is one of the worst doctors I have ever seen I lost my father because of him According to him surgery was successful But my father couldnt recover after surgery and remained in recovery room for around 10days after which we lost him The reason of death was mentioned as multiple organ failure though I know its because of these peoples incompetency

If a patient comes alive from OT after surgery it is counted as successful operation and it doesnt matter whether that patient survives after the surgery or not Please do not go to this doctor

He has removed my previous review Worst doctor I have ever met Big name but believe me he is totally incompetent doctor May be this review also gets deleted but no worries I will put it again

Also please notice all good reviews comments and their timing in last 6 months you will come to know whether genuine or fake reviews All good reviews are arranged I bet

Do not trust him for any major heart surgery He is not capable of handling complex cases Trust me or regret later on

Excellent  surgeon I was operated for CABG and AVR in October  2020 and am doing absolutely fine after passage of 3 years leading an active and trouble free lifeThank you Dr Meharwal and Fortis Escorts OkhlaThanks also to the wonderful team of Dr Meharwal who did a great job and also to Ms Preeti Saxena the ever efficient  Secretary  to the surgeon

A highly incompetentrude uncooperative person and his whole team I lost my husband in the hands of this demonMy husband went on his own to hospital but we never knew he will never come backHe never opened his eyes after surgery

The services received were excellent Dr Meharwal the team and the staff are friendly and ensured that proper information regarding health and care gets communicated Would have no qualms in recommending them to family and friends

During a routine test it was discovered I had a congenital heart problem where there was no option but open heart surgery to replace the valve Now started the hunt for a good surgeon someone who would do what was in my best interest and not that of the hospital or himself basically making money When we met Dr Meharwal the search ended We found a brilliant doctor who was also a brilliant human being Needless to say we have not regretted our decision even once and it had been 7 years since the surgery I do want to mention that after going to all the big name hospitals we still find that escortsfortis is one of the better hospitals and not as money minded as the others Also a special shout out to Dr Meharwals team specially the back office team who to date make us feel important It is also a reflection of the man heading the team

Got my AVR SURGERY done at Fortis Okhla by Dr ZS Meharwal In my basic research before finalising FORTIS Okhla For my AVR SURGERY i found Dr ZS Meharwal one of Highly professional surgeon with more than 30 years and 30000 surgeries of experience  which made me confident about my decesion and post surgery I must say  he is one of most renowned and best surgeon in delhi who closely monitors his patients and thier recovery at every level Heartful thanks to Dr ZS Meharwal and his team for my successful surgery

I first met Dr Meherwal in 2016 when my husband had to go through a valve transplant Having run from pillar to post before that met with so many cardiologists and not felt comfortable with any of them In the first meeting itself we knew we had found the right doctor He was so patient and answered an A4 sheet of questions I had carried with me The surgery went off flawlessly There were no post operative complications To date Dr Meherwal has always been there to for us Thank god for doctors like him who still have a heart and are not commercial or totally money minded yet brilliant at what they do
Felt I needed to add after reading some of the reviews preeti his assistant is a gem of a person and I have never found her rude or non helpful

Best cardiac surgeons in Delhi NCR Having impeccable track record great team and precise hand In our case  the surgery was highly risky however surgery was perfect even in such uncertain times Not only the Dr but his entire team and support staff such as Preeti ji Sachin Sehgal are highly approachable and add human touch to entire process
