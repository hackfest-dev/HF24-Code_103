My 13 year old son was cut in the ear by Dr Raman

When I pointed it out he kept denying it even though it could be seen with the naked eye

My sons airway condition worsened after a surgery done by him What was worse was that he deliberately gave an incorrect success rate in performing such surgeries He said his success rate was 98 and there was just one case where it was unsuccessful and that too because of some other congenital condition that the child had However after my sons surgery I spoke to at least a couple of people whose children got operated by him and the surgery wasnt successful I wonder how someone could play with the lives and future of such young kids

He needs  compulsory retirement
He doesnt have patience  at all
He asked nurse to put ear drops to my 8 years old daughter and told we will call in 30 minutesBut the fellow disappearedReceptionist said doctor is left for the dayRs650 is waste
He should learn patience and professional ethics firstwithout these qualities he doesnt deserve to be a doctor
He handover   his   OPD responsibility to interns and doesnot care about patients
I advise not to consult him

Met Dr E V Raman for my 3 years old son He was very polite humble and kind He and his team did great job in diagnosing and managing our sons problem We are grateful to him and his team I highly recommend Dr E V Raman

A doctor should be someone who travels beyond the health condition to understand the root cause of the issue  DR EV Raman is one such person who diagnose the root cause of the health system in the very beginning and help treat with his best of knowledge  I have also found him very comfortable while i drive with my set of challenges 

He is the best ENT Dr with the kindest nicest bedside manner
He operated on our son and I would recommend him world over
