I have gone through the surgery otitis media and mastoid exploration and Tympanoplasty under Doctor Dhruo Roy and it was a very nice experience and I am very much in good health now Dhruo Roy has expertise in all critical cases of ENT

Very bad experience He is not even heard the problems
Suggestion Do not consult with him further

He is awesome I love his Behaviour during the period from checkup to surgery of my Thyroglossal Cyst

Very very  good doctor behaviour is very good

Worst experience with him Asked for the tst worh rupees 6000 and do not bother to chk those reports

He is in such a hurry that even after knowing that all reports are ready and i was just rushing towards him he left Before that he was gossiping inside the clinic

Do not understand how to rate himHow a reputed hospital like AMRI accommodating him I have rushed to him taking leave from my work in such a busy hectic schedule but time is worthless for him
