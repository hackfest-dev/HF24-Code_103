He just killed my father
He is not a doctor He is a business man
He only tries to gain profit in Fortis hospital
Ill recommend that please do not visit this doctor and also Fortis Hospital

Totally worst doctor He does not know how to talk with the patient parties and his behaviour is very very bad Ha has no patience to talk Very very bad experience He just give tests and he prefers to admit patient in his hospital on immediate basis without use medicine and proper checkup

Worst doctor only busy in phones but get forget that he had taken 1650 fees from patient for checkup he only knows two things dialysis or transplant

Worst may be too much experience but only talks business Only wants to do transplant And earn money by it Worst never ever I will recommend anyone to consult ARDutta

DrArup Ratan Dutta is the best nephrologist in kolkata He is just GOD

Worst human worst doctor

Worst doctor
