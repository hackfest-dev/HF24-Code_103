Worst doctor he dont have basic sense to talk while consultation
He didnt even care to listen to whole history He just wanted to finish the appointment and move on
The most rash rude doctor who kept us waiting for more than 2 hours in spite of having an appointment
No proper response for our douts and clarification
Please dont visit this doctor
Highly unprofessional He should be fired from Appolosave yourself

Took exactly one minute to examine me barely talked or gave advice Even though an anti biotic was prescribed he didnt instruct on anti acidic medication or probiotics I had better sense Even after being told repeatedly I dont react well to a certain medicine he prescribed it and insisted on it because he really wasnt listening all along The most rash rude doctor who kept us waiting for 45 mins inspite of a booked appointment I was getting better before I went to him Not I am just throwing up and in much worse shape He didnt even care to listen to whole history or ask if I am allergic to any medications  thats the bare minimum by any doctor He just wanted to finish the appointment and move on He said its viral goodbye He should be fired save yourself Maybe he only cares if he has patients for surgery as that means money and this is barely anything Absolutely unethical

Worst doctor  he dont have basic commonsense to make patience sit and talk while consultation
