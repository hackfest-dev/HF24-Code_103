Dr Irfan Bashir is a gem of a person who listens and understands the patients concern in a very calm manner He is a highly experienced humble and down to earth personality My mother had first stage endometrium cancer and he treated her very well My entire family is thankful to him

He is one of the finest doctors Ive come across
My grandfather was suffering from small cell lung cancer we discovered it at age of 79 after visiting so many well known hospitals we couldnt get the right treatment for him his condition was deteriorating day by day then a doctor from one hospital referred Dr Bashir he came as a blessing in my grandfathers life He started to taking care of my grandfathers case and my grandfather was so relieved by his medicines and treatment This was his duty as well but other than this he is very humble in nature always very supportive
There was a time when we were in our hometown in hills and couldnt visit the hospital but at that time also he always assisted and supported us in each and every possible way Infact my grandfather only trusted him out of all the doctors he had met

He is one the most trusted doctor with a very humble heart

I met Dr Irfan Bashir when my grandmother was getting treated for cervix cancer years back in Batra hospital Over the years my interaction with him has been wonderful because inspite of having a busy schedule Dr Irfan was always there to give the correct information  has been emphathatic towards patients and care takers
His approach has always been to intently listen to the patients first provide right diagnosis  help in the healing process
I wish him the best and the world is a better place because of doctors like him

Dr Irfan is a doctor in the true sense of the word  Apart from being an expert in his area of focus he comes out as a very gentle and humble human being who uses empathy as a tool to make his patients feel safe and cared for I used to consult Dr Irfan for my father in law and he always had only good words to say about Dr Irfan A very good natured and well spirited doctor

My aunt was suffering from cancer from a long time and it was just we have lost hope But thanks to Dr Irfan his  humble nature patience and expertise not only helped her to show recovery from cancer but also helped her to get out of depression I am highly thankful to Dr Irfan I recommend him for his best practices

Dr Irfan Bashir is a naturally gifted and talented doctor A professional that knows and hold his work dear to the heart
If you have any need to consult an oncologist never think twice travel far and wide from anywhere you are in the globe and present your case and youll be glad to have made the right choice
Words can not express my satisfaction of the treatment plan he designed for my dad who is suffering from multiple myeloma and just barely two weeks into the treatment there was tremendous improvement
