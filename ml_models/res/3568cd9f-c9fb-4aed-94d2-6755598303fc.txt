Dr Fred William is the best endocrinologist in Bangalore Since April 2023 Ive been under his care for my diabetic and hypothyroidism treatment His strict adherence to procedures coupled with his compassionate nature make him a standout professional Dr Williams vast knowledge commitment to teaching and research make him an invaluable asset to society I highly recommend him for anyone seeking topnotch endocrine care

We are better off without doctors like him Saw him when going for a GI procedure as my tsh was high Though the medication was corrected by my doctor I was asked to see him When I asked him why I was losing weight with hypothyroidism this guy so arrogant and uncourteous had the nerve to tell me that I could be having cancer in my GI Fortunately I have nothing of that sort

Dr Fred William is not associated with Manipal now If anyone has any information about how can we contact him or get his consultation

He is the best in my knowledge Does anyone know where he is consulting He has left Manipal Varthur branch

He is practicing now at Tata MD Whitefield

This doctor is uncourteous He apparently wrote incorrect dosage which is not even available in the market The hospital even refused to give access over the phone to him for a later visit to get the same rectified We had to walkin once again from 10kms away to visit him and he just walked away casually disrespecting us and mentioning that I missed a zero in there Absolutely disrespectful

Dr Fred Williams is an asset for the society His diagnosis is extremely good and his quality of the treatment could not be compared Strongly recommended

Very nice too meat in discussion

Great doctor and his treatment is helpful for diabetics patients

Good
