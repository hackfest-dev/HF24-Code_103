My situation became worst after the surgery done by him I was much better before the surgeryi lost my health and wealthi regret my decision

One of the most experienced and humble doctors I have met His smiling and positive attitude treats half of the problem Dr Kriplani and his team were very supportive and efficient in ensuring the smooth procedure for my laparoscopic surgery Wishing good luck to the entire team for everything

A very well experienced and warm hearted doctor who treats his patients with utmost careHe came as an angel in our life to save my motherGod bless him with long healthy life so that he continues to treat his patients with his great knowledge and experience

Just there is much better doctors and in less cost and more caring and great results without his waiting and costing drama
Hes a commercial more then a medical

He is worst doctor He doesnt have time to clear patients doubt Fortis hospital is not a good hospital anymore All they want is your money

He is a life saver

God for me
