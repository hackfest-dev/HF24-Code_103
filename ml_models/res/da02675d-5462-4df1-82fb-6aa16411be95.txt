I have been consulting Dr Mithal for the last 10 years regarding a slew of chronic illnesses Hes always had the best bedside manner  he explains everything reassures you when things are not going the way you hoped and never shames you for any compliance lapse on your end If youre looking for an empathic doctor with a depth of knowledge your search ends here

I went to meet Dr Ambrish Mithal an endocrinologist at Max Gurgaon for  first time for my sugars  Though the waiting time is there but it was totally worth it his team covered all aspects of diabetes management  totally satisfied

He may be a very knowledgeable or senior doctor but his conduct with patients is very very bad He hardly gave me 30 second for my appointment and i was extremely disappointed

Dr Ambrish is an excellent endocrinologist Hes extremely knowledgeable and explains everything in a way thats easy to understand He truly cares about his patients wellbeing

Dr Ambrish is one of the best endocrinologists Ive ever had His knowledge and expertise in diabetes management is impressive I highly recommend him

Ive been seeing Dr Ambrish for several years now and hes been instrumental in helping me manage my thyroid condition Hes a great listener and always takes the time to address my concerns

My wife had the misfortune of turning to this incompetent doctor for consultation at Apollo regarding her newly identified diabetes in 2007

1 He was on his cellphone throughout the consultation  obviously an egomaniac who does not listen to his patients

2 He advised medication for both diabetes and hypertension  without considering that the hypertension was a symptom  He said the medication would be lifelong The medication was so strong that she was dizzy and uncomfortable  till an alternate doctor reduced her medication and stopped the hypertension medication completely

3 After his consultation this megalomaniac referred her to his dietician  Who immediately recommended that she should lose 10 kg  My wife was quite thin and weighed 55 Kg at the time  and would have disappeared if she lost 10kg Obviously incompetent hires incompetent

4 Go to anyone else if you want to have your diabetes cured  My wife was weaned off her medication through slight change of lifestyle and exercise by her alternate doctor  within 7 months  This was 15 years ago and she is still medication free

Pathetic experience I have booked an online appointment for my wife 2 junior doctors had conversation with us for history and questions to be asked We have taken appointment for 4 oclock but we received call from Dr Ambarish Mittal at 5 oclock All the points were not discussed Our reports were not checked Not attended properly not listened us clearly He connected us for just 4 minutes and disconnected phone without telling us Then received prescription after 48 hours Worst consultation experience with Dr Ambarish Mittal Consultation fee was 2400 which is really high Its better to donate 2400 Rs to someone than giving it to Dr Ambarish Mittal for consultation
Never ever go for consultation

Dr Ambrish is a wonderful endocrinologist Hes very approachable and takes the time to explain things in detail Hes also very knowledgeable about the latest treatments and technologies

My father is the most happiest person just  because of Dr Mithal His guidance and medication  made his life back from unresponsive man to very much healthy today Last 10 years my father follows all his guidance and today he is healthy and happy person Thank you to Dr Mithal for giving and guiding the right thing to do someone who has a diabetes My father always talk about Dr Mithal that he always ask dont believe in myth just believe in real fact
