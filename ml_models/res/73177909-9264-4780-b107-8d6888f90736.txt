Dr Abrar is the most kind hearted person and an even better Doctor He listens to his patients problems and treats them accordingly Went to his chamber at Kankurgachi Apollo several times hes doing great work  May Allah bless him abundantly

To us he is like God Because of him my aunt has recovered and has again started walking No words are enough to express our gratitude towards him

Dr Ahmed is definitely one of the best Doctors that I have interacted with He performed a spine surgery on my Mum in August 2021 Very grateful for his wonderful behaviour and fantastic treatment Truely commendable and very reliable and approachable My Ma was in excruciating pain when we saw him the surgery was a relatively risky surgery as Ma has several comorbidities Thanks to God and Dr Ahmed there is some hope now

Dr Ahmed is the best We are very fortunate that we got to know him It was our privilege that he performed my mothers spine surgery He is always accessible which is very important for a patients family My mother was bed ridden for 6 months Portion of my mothers lumbar spine was disintegrated We consulted many specialists in the Kolkata Bangalore Vellore and each had different opinion which was confusing for us Then we met Dr Ahmed He was very patient in assessing my mothers situation He explained the issue the process to resolve the issue the outcome and what to expect At that point we really understood the issue which was comforting for us Post surgery my mother is walking again I highly recommend Dr Ahmed for anyone in need of spinal surgery

Dr Abrar Ahmed is very good spine surgeon My Father had severe prolapsed disc space on Lumbar area which was operated by Dr Abrar Ahmed successfully on 2016  My father became normal and fit after operations with no post operations complexity

Due to a catastrophe one spinal cod bone of my grandmother has broken in 4 pices at age 70 And she was in last stage near about all the doctors say we are helpless But Dr Ahmed made a vartiboplasti and now my grandmother doing daily morning walks So thats the deferrance
He is next to god

Dr Abrar Ahmed in Kolkata is a number 1 fraud doctor I consulted him back at Apollo He is completely into medical mafia and is into commission system  Because of such doctors the prestige of entire doctor community gets besmirched and we start doubting doctors tricking patients for money He is not at all fit to be called a doctor I went to him at Apollo Gariahat for my spine problem He gave me highly expensive medical tests to be done from Apollo only and not from anywhere else He forced me to take physiotherapy from his ally Arif Ahmed inspite of telling him that I have my own physiotherapist he forced me to take services from Arif who increased my spine pain with wrong therapy and high fees per session in which I am sure Dr Abrar too had his commissions NEVER GO TO THIS DOCTOR

Doesnt speak with patient Doesnt even do a review Doesnt spell out what to expect from a surgery Totally indifferent

Dr Ahmed is the best surgeon in Kolkata My mother in law was suffering from severe back pain and she cant even walk So I cosulted Dr Ahmed and he referred me a physiotherapist Dr Arif Azam My mother in law was told to do the operation by many doctors  But Dr Ahmed suggested physiotherapy and some medicines Physiotherapist Dr Arif Azam has magical hands who recovered my mother in law with physiotherapy and some medicines Now she can walk and can do works She recovered 80 percent I am so glad to consult Dr Ahmed and highly recommended

Such a pathetic doctori dont know why people praise him a lot but personally i feel that he is a very rude and arrogant doc
