I am from UK and travel a lot around the world I can truly say that he is the best ENT surgeon I have ever been to He did my septoplasty during my trip to India Delhi So knowledgeable caring and experienced  Even my doctor in the UK couldnt believe how well the surgery was performed Thanks doc

Dr PL Dhingra is one of worst doctor I have visited despite of his vast experience of 45 yearsI had visited him at Apollo Indraprastha Hospital Delhi for my ear problem and he had done my ear surgery and nose surgery Tympanoplasty  septoplasty After surgery of my ear same has been infected blood comes out from ear  there become 2 hole in newly inserted ear drum I had again consulted him several times but he only provides ear drop without giving antibiotic medicine for healing infection of my ear When I asked about why my ear surgery failed he provide several excuses like not to do surgery in the rainy season and so on along with advice to do again same surgery of my same ear but he did not inform me of anything like this before surgery

Then i visited a different doctor who told me that Dr PL Dhingra has made mistakes  while doing surgery that he did not eradicate infection of the inner bone of my ear and just changed the ear drum Kan ka jali and also Dr PL Dhingra did not suggest me to do CT scan of my ear although there was a main problem in my ear instead of my nose just like CT scan of brain in the fracture of bone of leg

Nowadays Dr PL Dhingra is just taking money from patients and not treating them well Rs 2000 per visitseems like he is just fooling people by his polite and soft behaviourI wasted my Rs 180000  and 3 months just because of his bad treatment

So please do not visit him by seeing his vast experience like I visited and suffer because of his bad treatment

Dont waste your time

One of the best ENT DOCTOR in Delhi
