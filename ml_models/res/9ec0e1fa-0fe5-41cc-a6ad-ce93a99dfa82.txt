Thanku sir

I had personally known Dr Harnarayan Singh since November 2013 when I had a seizure and on being diagnosed with Fronto basal meningioma was advised to undergo surgery I had my fears and anxiety associated with the treatment but talking to him and the team helped me understand that I was in safe hands with the way procedure was discussed and my request for minimizing my anxiety were all addressed to and pre and post surgery care was well managed  It did not end there as the post recovery also a hand holding is required as one resumes day to day life and I had been stationed abroad and Dr Singh was so kind to be always available to answer questions and advise over calls or messages and the relationship has evolved and he besides being  thorough professional has this quality of supporting patients with a personal connections which I believe is a must for overall aspect of treatment I am very thankful for being under his treatment and hand holding and wish more and more Doctors to follow suit

Thanks Dr Harnarayan for always being there and my Best wishes to you in your career and all your endeavors

It is not all about the surgery alone but all the things that you experience before and after also The fear and emotions before the apprehensions and roadblocks during recovery One of my distant relatives came to Delhi NCR trying to get admission for a brain tumor surgery in AIIMS But the waiting list was huge They were not very financially well off also A friend suggested about Dr Harnarayan Singh We met him and the surgery was advised on an urgent basis as the tumor was looking like cancer The surgery was done successfully and it was confirmed that the tumour was cancerous Glioblastoma multiforme The hospital billing was also very helpful about the finances as well  After the surgery they went back to their home place and continued further treatment in Patna They are in regular touch with the doctor through teleconsultation It was an amazing experience He is a skilled surgeon and is perhaps the best surgeon for high grade brain tumors

Dr Harnarayan Singh is an exceptional surgeon and human being He is the best Neurosurgeon for Lumbar microdiscectomy and spinal stenosis surgery Best Neurosurgeon in Gurgaon He is very humble and answer all the queries of patient

We met him for lumbar laminectomy surgery It was suggested by an Orthopaedician He advised us about MIS lumbar decompression which is a keyhole type newer technique of Lumbar laminectomy We were confused initially but then we searched on the net The keyhole technique is painless and very effective We went on with Dr Harnarayan Singh and got the surgery done I could start walking after 4 hours of surgery There was some pain at operation area but it was manageable  I was completely satisfied I can walk much better now There is still some numbness in my left leg but I think it will improve over time He is an expert spine surgeon Thank you so much

I had to wait for over half an hour even after taking an appointment So it started on a disappointing note as I was getting late for my own work He apologised about it later I saw him because of a nagging back pain I had taken medicines from many doctors in Gurgaon and NCR but they worked as long as I took the medicines  Medicines were making my stomach hurt as well and I wanted a long term solution That is when I met him He stressed about exercises proper bending technique lifestyle adjustments weight loss and posture He took extra time in showing me how to sit and lift things properly Its been six weeks since I first met him and gradually I have started to feel a lot better Now in retrospect I think it was worth waiting for him in the OPD

Thank you Dr Harnarayan for all the help and guidance for the spinal stenosis surgery He is definitely the best when it comes to keyhole spine surgery Once again kind regards and keep up the good work

Dr Harnarayan Singh is very professionally qualified in his field and humanitarian in his approach He deals with each patient with humane touch and gets to the root of the problem I had a very godly experience with him as he dealt with my fathers rarest of the rare disease D89 MRSA and VRSA vertebral osteomyelitis with cord compression The disease is under research case study by experts of other various hospitals too He was available round the clock through all means in our difficult times Even though he had successfully treated spinal issues but he took an extra mile of effort and was always involved with further treatment of VRSA which was the domain of infection specialist After a painful struggle of 15 years due to relapsing of infection several times we were able to finally cure it on the basis of advise given by him He is a gem in his field who is not money minded and is rather compassionate towards his patients and their family I will always remain grateful and indebted to him for all he has done Thank you so much Dr Harnarayan Singh
