My dad is seeing Dr Mittal for the last 5 years He always complained about shortness of breath and he was unable to walk more than 500 steps after having CABG Dr Mittal just dismissed his concerns every time saying his reports are fine

When my dad came to USA we took him to a hospital for evaluation it was found that a critical medication was missing Lasics to reduce excess water from the body which was filled in his lungs heart and upper abdomen causing difficulty in breathing He also changes medication without even telling the reasons for it

Very disappointed with the way the patients are being treated without even investigating the cause of the issue Not recommended

He is really a great doctor with lots of positive energy which always motivates us DrSanjay Mittal is treating my father since 2012 and we have complete trust on him Just by looking at my fathers face he tells the issue Dr Mittal is really a great doctor Thanks for all your support and guidance doctor

His sincere approach towards any patient is appreciable Being a layman we cant judge his abilities but can rely on his suggestion

They give appointment online and then are not available when you reach the hospital and dont even revert if you happen to reach them by the receptionist staff at Hosp Wasting time of patients and harassment

He is not able to understand patient problem Not want to listen

The rudest doctor I have ever met

Just one word Living god
