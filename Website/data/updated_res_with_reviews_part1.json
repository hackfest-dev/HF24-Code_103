He tells you the issue and in the same breath tells you how he\u2019s going to treat it ! His diagnosis is always spot on and he doesn\u2019t believe in over medicating . He was God sent for us . Today our son is home , a happy man , all courtesy Dr Randhir Sud . May God bless him with a long , happy and healthy life ! I can\u2019t really describe him well enough , words fail me . It\u2019s no wonder he is the best Gastroenterologist in our country. He is a blessing to humanity , have personally witnessed how people look to him for advice , from all over the world .

His son is very junior, un-professional, in-human, rude, illiterate, careless, has no human value. We cannot even call him a doctor with his behavior. I almost lost my father because of his mistake!!\n\nThey spoilt my father's case, created fistula (a hole in the food-pipe) during endoscopy-dilation and did not even inform us. When we went to him again he did some swallow test which worsened my fathers condition and left my father choking, breathless and extreme coughing - my father was in a dying condition.. Dr. Sukrit did not take any preventive action, he didnt even give the report of the test and told us very rudely that he cannot do anything and asked us to take our father away (in a condition where other doctor would have called for critical response team). Maybe he got frightened because he found about the fistula in the test and wanted to shoo us away.\nHow come a son is practicing under his father in the same hospital? This is clear conflict of interest. Father being the mentor will never acknowledge/agree to his Son's mistakes. Maybe Sukrit just got some degree using his father's reference/money.\nOverall pathetic experience with Medanta because of all this."

After surgery of my ear, same has been infected ,blood comes out from ear & there become 2 hole in newly inserted ear drum. I had again consulted him several times but he only provides ear drop without giving antibiotic medicine for healing infection of my ear. When I asked about why my ear surgery failed, he provide several excuses like not to do surgery in the rainy season and so on along with advice to do again same surgery of my same ear but he did not inform me of anything like this before surgery.\n\nThen i visited a different doctor who told me that Dr. PL Dhingra has made mistakes  while doing surgery that he did not eradicate infection of the inner bone of my ear and just changed the ear drum( Kan ka jali) and also Dr. PL Dhingra did not suggest me to do CT scan of my ear although there was a main problem in my ear instead of my nose (just like CT scan of brain in the fracture of bone of leg)\n\nNowadays Dr. PL Dhingra is just taking money from patients and not treating them well (Rs 2000 per visit)...seems like he is just fooling people by his polite and soft behaviour.....I wasted my Rs 1,80,000/-  and 3 months just because of his bad treatment.\n\nSo, please do not visit him by seeing his vast experience like I visited and suffer because of his bad treatment"

After consulting general physician for a couple of days I had to consult a neuro physician. Since I am not from Delhi and came just 2 years back, I had no clue of which doctor to consult. Then one of my relative suggested Dr Renjen's name and by God's grace I got his appointment however I was very sckeptical before meeting him as there are certain reviews about him which is completely misleading (never believe until you experience it). He appeared to me as God more than a doctor.His listening capacity to his patients problem solves half of it. He made sure that I understand the issue and gave me a broader picture about the upcoming lifestyle changes and disease Management. Dr Dinesh is also a very humble and amazing doctor and am sure he will be an asset to wherever he works. The entire team of Dr Renjen especially Rakesh are commendable. I would highly recommend Dr Renjen as you will feel safe and taken care of with him."

The success of the surgery depends on a number of factors, including the skill and experience of the surgeon.\n\nWhen choosing a doctor to perform open heart surgery, it is important to look for someone who has the necessary training and credentials, as well as a track record of success in performing the procedure. You may also want to consider factors such as the doctor's communication style, bedside manner, and willingness to answer your questions and address your concerns.\n\nIn addition to selecting a skilled and experienced surgeon, it is also important to choose a hospital that has a strong reputation for cardiac care and a comprehensive support team, including nurses, anesthesiologists, and other healthcare professionals.\n\nUltimately, the success of open heart surgery depends on a number of factors, including the skill and experience of the surgeon, the quality of the medical team and facilities, and the overall health of the patient.

This doctor advised to go for a surgery which is a major one.\nRather than following his advice blindly, I paused the treatment process there and moved to Apollo Hospital, Chennai.\n\nThe doctor at Apollo said that, he would try to treat the issue with medicine. Because, the surgery would be very very risky and life threatening. So, that is my experience with this  business minded doctor who cares only for the nursing home he works at and not the patient.\n\nMy advice to this gentleman is that he should sit in a meat shop with a dagger in his hand rather than sitting in a doctor's chair.

As my uncle's age was not permit for surgery we depend on medication. After 1year (more/less) treatment my uncle recovered completely. Naturally he stated to depend on Dr S.N Basak blindly. He was too much obedient patient and always keep in touch with doctors. Doctors suggest to do pet scan every year and my uncle did the same accordingly. After Dec'2022 problem raised again and my uncle went to doctor but he said report is good and there has no problem seen, difficulties continued to increased. In April'23 Dr. S N Basak admit that malignancy come back according to Pet scan report Dec'2022 by then, my uncle's health had worsened. We did not get any help and as well as guide from Dr S.N.Basak and his behavior was too rude and hopeless. Everytime when my uncle went for check up, he told \" I have saved you 4 years, you are not supposed to live this long\". Whatever, we started treatment again under Dr S N Basak dated 12.06.2023, we can't able to moving out from him as my uncle biased and trusted on him blindly. My uncle discharged from hospital on 16.06.2023 but there was no improvement and his health condition started getting worse. on 23.06.2023 my uncle went to Dr S N Basak for check up, doctor told his patient (my uncle) directly that, \"he will not survive further and advice to take mental preparation, ask to complete all doings as he has no time\". I have never heard a doctor to tell a patient directly that he/she will not live long and nothing to do. After that, my uncle totally devastated with his word as he depends on him like \"GOD\" and passed away on 30.06.2023.   This is my humble request please think many times before go to Dr S N Basak for treatment...He only knows money nothing else."

From the moment we stepped into his office, he greeted us with a dismissive demeanor, as if our concerns were insignificant and he had more important matters to attend to. His cold and condescending behavior left us feeling like mere inconveniences rather than human beings desperately seeking guidance and support during a difficult time.\n\nBut what truly sealed Dr. Basak's reputation as the worst oncologist imaginable was his complete disregard for my father's well-being. Instead of providing hope, empathy, or even a shred of optimism, he callously shattered any remaining positivity my father had left. He delivered the news of my father's prognosis in a cold and detached manner, leaving us feeling utterly hopeless and defeated. Rather than exploring treatment options or discussing potential avenues for support, he swiftly dismissed any possibility of recovery, leaving us in a state of shock and despair.\n\nTo make matters worse, it became painfully clear that Dr. Basak's primary motivation was money, not the well-being of his patients.\nIn conclusion, Dr. SK Basak is an oncologist who should be avoided at all costs. His rude and unprofessional demeanor, lack of compassion, and money-driven approach make him utterly unsuited for the critical and sensitive field of oncology. Our experience with him was nothing short of a nightmare, and I would strongly advise anyone seeking quality care for themselves or their loved ones to steer clear of this doctor."

He blamed me for  my heart condition and on top he scared the heck out of me,  told we are not sure about the surgery success Rate looking at your health condition anything can happen. When we asked about surgery , he was like what Surgery ? You are in way fit for CABG    He told We will be doing  lots test on the same day of my first consultation  The way he spoke literally  , as if I would die on the surgery table itself for 99.9%. He indirectly told  since i am Responsible  for my health condition so now I better pay . Probably what he told was truth about success  rate but the way he put  it across was very bad and Dirty . I had lots of other complications and so developed Blockage quickly he failed to understand  that while other doc understood the same. Now I am still alive without surgery and taking medicines . He told all negative things and kept on  blaming  me for the condition while I consulted other cardiologist  surgeon in Gangaram and Escorts but they sounded so positive and they told not to worry . Infact the Dr. At gangaram was really too good . A very postive mind and very good attitude he had. The first doc in I dia to have done heart transplant  in a private hospital. He obviously knew how to make you feel relaxed and Confident  . Apollo is shopping mall of Doc. Never visit Apollo . Better go to Ganaga Ram or to escorts"

We meet DR Purshotttham lal (Metro group of hospital ) and doctor VIVEKA ( Max saket), Dr S. radhakrishna( Fortis escort heart institute). and three of them told us that there is no need of surgery in this case and it can be done with the simple invasive procedure like they do to remove heart blockage with catheter.Finally we were satisfied with Dr. S Radhakrishnan and my mother is completely fine and we are really thankful to doctor.One more thing charges in fortis escort is quite less and patient care and hygiene is good.I would suggest you to avoid such doctors and meet other one."

I was admitted at Kokilaben hospital for some other issues.That time somehow my face turned red. He came to visit me as a skin specialist.

Without knowing anything I continuously applied that medicine and got black spots on my face. Last week I went to visit him he said I had to stop that medicine after one month.

He was on his cellphone throughout the consultation - obviously an egomaniac who does not listen to his patients\n\n2. He advised medication for both diabetes and hypertension - without considering that the hypertension was a symptom.  He said the medication would be lifelong. The medication was so strong that she was dizzy and uncomfortable - till an alternate doctor reduced her medication and stopped the hypertension medication completely.\n\n3. After his \u201cconsultation\u201d this megalomaniac referred her to his \u201cdietician\u201d.  Who immediately recommended that she should lose 10 kg.  My wife was quite thin and weighed 55 Kg at the time - and would have disappeared if she lost 10kg. Obviously incompetent hires incompetent.\n\n4. Go to anyone else if you want to have your diabetes \u201ccured\u201d.

The results came in 4 days and my visit would have been free but still he called me after 7 days (asking to repeat same meds)just to mint some extra  money. He keeps pushing to get medicines from the pharmacy outside the hospital to get commissions. Even for simple medicines like omega 369 , he would write medicines of very 3rd grade companies.

On January 23rd 2023, I experienced a severe pain in my stomach along with vomiting and was diagnosed with a gallbladder stone of 8mm in size. I was very worried about the surgery as the general surgeon I first consulted mentioned it would be a critical surgery and that I might even have jaundice.\n\nHowever, after hearing about Dr. Debashis Deb, I went for a consultation with him on 26th January. He saw my reports and immediately admitted me for the surgery, which he performed on 30th January at K.D. Cure Nursing Home.\n\nDuring the laparoscopic surgery, there were moments where the procedure seemed impossible due to the severe inflammation of my gallbladder. But, Dr. Debashis Deb's expertise and experience helped him to successfully complete the laparoscopic surgery and remove my gallbladder and the stone.\nThe surgery was successful and got released the next day.\n\nI was amazed by the care and attention that Dr. Debashis Deb showed throughout the entire process. He made sure that I was comfortable and answered all of my questions. He even checked on me after the surgery and was always available to answer my messages on WhatsApp.\n\nI am truly grateful for Dr. Debashis Deb's help and would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking for a gallbladder surgery. He is truly a blessing and a highly skilled and experienced surgeon. I cannot thank him enough for his kindness and professionalism.\n\nBless Dr. Debashis Deb for his amazing work \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude4f"

It was Sunday and she had to be rushed to the emergency of Apollo hospital, belapur. Dr. Vikram Paode conducted the emergency surgery at about 12:00 in the night and fixed the broken bone and the fracture of another bone. After a month another surgery was performed to remove the implant. And now after a month my daughter is on the path to recovery. Dr. Paode is a skilled professional in his field. He conducted the whole procedure with utmost care and professionalism and made all of us comfortable with his timely reviews and updates. Dr. Paode\u2019s assistants are also very supportive and skilled. We are very thankful to dr. Paode for the surgery and subsequent guidance through the healing process."

I have sought medical assistance from numerous physicians around the globe for my gastroenterology issues, but after consulting with Dr. Gita Billa, I am overjoyed and completely satisfied with the exceptional level of care I received. Dr. Billa's approach to my case was truly remarkable - she displayed an incredible attention to detail in her responses and diagnosis. Her reports were thorough and comprehensive, reflecting her commitment to providing the best possible care. Furthermore, her understanding and empathy towards my concerns were truly commendable. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically recommend Dr. Gita Billa to anyone seeking a highly skilled and compassionate gastroenterologist. She is undoubtedly a gem in her field."

My father was severely ill when he started treatment under Dr Geeta and we got best advice regarding his condition and palliative care. She strives to help her patients in the best possible manner. I found her to be extremely delligent and intelligent in her diagnosis. We shifted treatment from Kokilaben Ambani hospital to Hiranandani at Powai only because we wished to continue under her supervision and doctor had shifted there ! Thank you doctor for caring for my father in his crisis."

We visited Dr Geeta Malkan Billa after the scheduled Gastroscopy for my mother followed by OPD.\nWe discussed the findings in the reports she has suggested and also she has prescribed the medicines for diabetic and gastrology problems to my mother.\nIn the prescription she also mentioned the name of the medicines which need to be taken for the high blood pressure issues (which I came to know after I visited the pharmacy in the premises of Hiranandani hospital) for which my mother was already taking treatment from a cardiac specialist doctor. The doctor has made few changes in the medications which my mother was consuming for high blood pressure.\nSo I again went to doctor to ask about the medications she has suggested for the high blood pressure.\nWhen I reached her in her cabin on the 7th floor, she literally shouted at us and refused to attend my query for the high bp medicines which were prescribed by her (though it\u2019s not her speciality). She also mentioned that she has been suffering from high fever since last night and she will not attend any of my queries regarding the medications she has prescribed.\nI have few questions here as follows:\n1. If Dr. Geeta Malkan Billa was not physically (due to high fever as mentioned by her) or mentally fit then how did she do the gastroscopy procedure on my mother  and also attended OPD for others?\n2. If any patient has taken medicines not in a correct manner (because the patient has wrongly understood the medication course) and if anything goes wrong with the patient, then who will be responsible in such a case? Doctor who is treating a patient or L.H. Hiranandani Hospital?\nAfter that I lost trust on her and went to some other very senior doctor in Lilavati Hospital, he has clearly mentioned that as an Gasterology specialist no doctor can prescribe medicines for High Blood pressure and Diabetes. If any doctor is prescribed such then it\u2019s total money making business of doctor.\nBy having such rude and unprofessional doctors  Dr. L.H. Hiranandani Hospital are keeping the reputation at stake. The similar kind of experiences (behavioural issues) was faced by many patients in the recent past."

In our initial meeting she spent considerable time understanding my medical history rather than just jumping to giving her prescription. In my next consultation with her she explained to me the root cause of my repeated infections , something that had been blatantly ignored by the most prominent doctors in Mumbai. From then onwards began my journey of trust , resilience and cure with Dr.Billa. Over the last 11 years of my treatment with her I have found her to be an extremely kind, intelligent and compassionate individual who strives to help her patients in the best possible manner. Her in depth knowledge and intellect makes her one of the most exquisite doctors in the profession. Not only has my health improved but she has always been genuine in guiding me. In today\u2019s world where doctors are merely concerned with filling their pockets and disregarding the patient and their emotions ( something I have experienced) Dr.Billa is in the truest sense of the words a DOCTOR. An individual who does everything in her capacity to help her patients recover. I will forever be grateful to her."

Confronted with the complexity of the case, we consulted several neurosurgeons, only to be met with hesitation and concern over the risky and intricate nature of the required surgery. The lesion\u2019s precarious position necessitated a highly skilled approach, with each potential surgical route fraught with its own set of risks and complications.\n\nOur search for hope led us to Dr. Sudhir Dubey at Medanta Hospital. From our first meeting, his confidence and mastery in neurosurgery brought us the solace we so desperately needed. Despite the daunting prognosis, Dr. Dubey's assurance gave us the courage to proceed.\n\nThe surgery on 28th February 2024 was a pivotal moment in our lives. Dr. Dubey and his team, with their exceptional skill, successfully removed the tumor, confirmed to be a benign mature teratoma through biopsy. The precision and care with which they navigated the complex operation were nothing short of miraculous.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to Dr. Sudhir Dubey and his team for their lifesaving expertise, compassion, and unwavering dedication. Our son's recovery is a testament to their remarkable abilities and the grace that guided us to them. Words fall short of expressing our deep gratitude for the renewed hope and life they have given our son.\n\nDr. Dubey, you are not just a phenomenal surgeon but a beacon of hope for families like ours. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for giving our son a second chance at life. Our journey from despair to gratitude is a story of your exceptional care and our son\u2019s resilient spirit."

And then Dr Das came as a ray of light in our lives as he promised a quick healing through surgery and assured us discharge in 3-4 days only. Though sceptical and scared of surgery , we trusted him and he stood true to his words!\nNot only he did a fantastic job with the surgery but also provided us with endless moral support and personal care throughout the procedure.It all went so seamlessly. Dr Das is humble and caring for his patients apart from being a deft spine surgeon, which is a rare quality these days. We walked home happy and satisfied with our experience at ISIC , Delhi. All the staff were extremely supportive and cooperative too. Thank you for everything . She is now able to walk properly and even do her daily chores well.\nAttaching a few pictures of my happy Mother in law post surgery.\nMehendi Hans\nBhubaneswar, Odisha."

Dr. Kalidutta's approach was nothing short of brilliant, as he not only explained the intricacies of the problem but also guided us seamlessly through the entire treatment process.Dr. Kalidutta's commitment to thoroughness was evident in his insistence on running comprehensive tests before considering surgery. This thorough approach gave us confidence in the decisions made, and we truly appreciated his dedication to ensuring the best possible outcome.One of the standout aspects of our experience was Dr. Kalidutta's accessibility. He was consistently available, even during odd hours, and remained reachable via phone. This level of responsiveness alleviated our concerns and reinforced our trust in his expertise.The surgery itself was a resounding success, and the post-operative care provided at the hospital was exceptional. Dr. Kalidutta's attention to detail and commitment to patient well-being truly set him apart.My father, now a staunch admirer of Dr. Kalidutta, humorously suggests he could spearhead a campaign for the doctor to become the President of India at any moment. This sentiment is a testament to the profound impact Dr. Kalidutta has had on our family.Once again, thank you to Dr. Kalidutta and the entire healthcare team for delivering an experience that exceeded our expectations. We are truly grateful for the exceptional care provided."

He was not able to sleep on his bed due to pain on his spine and  had discomfort while walking too. We went to Indian Spinal Health Centre New Delhi and consulted Dr. Kalidutta Dash. He had checked my father first and asked us to do some test - X ray and MRI. Basis the reports he very meticulously explained the cause , solution and future implications as well. My father had gone through a spinal surgery which was done by Dr Kalidutta. By God\u2019s grace everything went well and the surgery was successful. My father after 1 month of surgery is doing absolutely fine, able to walk and do his work himself slowly & gradually without any discomfort . Dr Kalidutta and his team ensured that the patient and the family members go through a smooth process throughout and also supported us mentally by building confidence. We would definitely recommend Dr Kalidutta and his team & also the hospital for any spine related problem. Rest assured you all are in safe hands. Thanks once again . Regards - Arpan Paul"

Now my brother is completely pain free as if it didn't exist.\nMore than happy and satisfied that we chose Dr. Das.

Before, I met him, I was bedridden with unbearable back pain since a year which left me almost partially paralysed by my left leg. My family were quite worried about my health, so they took me to Indian Spinal injuries centre Delhi. When Dr. Das saw me he immediately diagnosed my problem and got me admitted in the Everest ward and I was opreated upon the very next day i.e on 4th of July 2023.\nAfter that surgery miraculously, I regained my health back and started walking again like before and all my back pain and discomforts were gone. I feel so much relieved and feeling like reborn. Today, I can do everything that I earlier used to do. I have no words to thank Dr.Das, his team and Indian spinal injuries centre Delhi.. Whenever, I visit Delhi I manage out time and make it sure to make a courtesy visit to Dr. Das and the hospital because it\u2019s because of him I\u2019m smiling today. May Almighty God bless Dr. Das in abundance with healthy and long life to serve people like us..\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2665\ufe0f"

Thank you so much madam for making our dream come true.\nNo other doctors would understand the issues in detail and be supported in any manner. We had undergone the advice of multiple doctors overseas, but of no use.\nAfter 8 years of marriage struggle for the kids, we are finally under guidance of the best doctor who could finally listen to our problem and provide support throughout my IVF treatment.\nThe way the doctor has shown confidence and transparency with our issues was really appreciated. Just like a family member (Elder Sister),she was always encouraged not to lose hope.\nNot only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.\nIt's rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care.\nI never was made to wait. And if ever I needed to contact her or her staff, they were super speedy in responding to my inquiries.\nI really cannot express my gratitude in words and how heart touching every appointment we had with her.Thank you so much God for giving wonderful opportunity to meet Dr.Lakshmi Krishna Leela madam\nand under her guidance was able to conceive and in my First Trimester at the moment.\nThe Clinic is inviting and her beautiful staff members are friendly,caring and helpful in every way and well maintained infrastructure.\n\nI highly recommend becoming her patient!"
