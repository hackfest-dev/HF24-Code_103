I was playing a sport after a considerable amount of time and ended up twisting my knee leading to an ACL + meniscus tear on my right knee.\nIt\u2019s been 6 years from my surgery now, my knee feels as normal as before.\nDr. Gajjar took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, address any concerns I had, and ensure I was comfortable throughout the entire process. Their professionalism, knowledge, and skill instilled confidence in me from the start.\nThe surgery itself was a success, and I'm grateful for Dr. Gajjar\u2019s precise work. The recovery process has been smoother than I anticipated, thanks to the thorough instructions and follow-up care provided by Dr. Gajjar and their staff.\nNot only did they demonstrate outstanding surgical skill, but they also showed genuine care and empathy for my well-being. I felt supported every step of the way, which made a significant difference in my recovery journey.\nOverall, I highly recommend Dr. Gajjar to anyone in need of knee ACL surgery or orthopedic care. Their expertise, professionalism, and compassionate approach truly set them apart. Thank you, Dr. Gajjar, for helping me regain mobility and improving my quality of life."

Post the 3 month and feeling no relief I took a second opinion which, to my absolute shock, advised surgery due to ACL and LCL tear. After doing further diligence we found Dr Gajjar to whom we went for a 3rd opinion.\n\nHe too confirmed my worst fear that surgery was, indeed, imperative. His examination was precise and he exuded so much confidence, patience in explaining and listening/addressing my anxiety. I immediately knew that he would be the best at dealing with this multiple intervention know as the \"unhappy triad\" involving the ACL, LCL and Miniscus.\n\nThe surgery went ahead within a week of my visit in Feb 23 and the journey of recovery started thereafter under the watchful and concerned oversight by Dr Gajjar and his recommended team of physiotherapists.\n\nDr Gajjar, as he was on my first visit to him, came across truly as an absolute professional, very thorough in his skill and always keeping total healing as his primary goal. He was never satisfied with me just being fine, for him my achieving total flexibility and strength and nothing less was the singular and clarion objective.\n\nI cannot thank Dr Gajjar enough for not just being a great surgeon but an excellent human and for his dedication to the well being of those in his care."

Gajjar for the life-changing transformation it brought about. Before the surgery, my father was plagued by chronic knee pain, faced significant difficulties in walking and standing, and his quality of life had greatly deteriorated. However, after the surgery performed by Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, my father's life has taken a remarkable turn for the better.\n\nFrom the very first consultation with Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, we were impressed by his professionalism and expertise. He took the time to thoroughly explain the procedure, its benefits, and any potential risks, ensuring that we felt well-informed and at ease with the decision to proceed. His compassionate and reassuring demeanor instilled confidence in our choice of surgeon.\n\nThe surgery itself was a resounding success. Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar and his surgical team demonstrated exceptional skill and precision, resulting in a seamless procedure. Post-surgery, my father's recovery was closely monitored by Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar and his dedicated medical staff, which greatly contributed to a smooth and efficient rehabilitation process.The results have been nothing short of astonishing.\n\nBefore the surgery, my father's knee pain made it nearly impossible for him to walk, run, or even bend his legs comfortably. But now, he is not only able to walk and stand without pain but has also regained the ability to run and bend his legs. The transformation in his mobility and overall quality of life has been truly remarkable.\n\nDr. Shreyash M. Gajjar goes above and beyond the call of duty. He takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being, providing detailed post-surgery care instructions and ensuring that any concerns are promptly addressed. His commitment to his patients' recovery is evident, and it has made all the difference in my father's journey to better health.\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar highly enough for his exceptional skill, compassionate care, and dedication to his patients. His knee osteotomy surgery has truly been life-changing for my father, allowing him to regain his mobility, independence, and quality of life. If you or a loved one are facing similar knee issues, Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar is undoubtedly the surgeon you can trust for a successful and transformative outcome. We are eternally grateful for his expertise and care.\n\nThank you, Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar, for giving my father a new lease on life."

A general orthopedic for bones related issues and a sports orthopedic for muscles tendons etc etc which is DR SHREYASH GAJJAR.\n4) bones related issues r detected in Xrays n muscles related issues r detected in MRI so when ur pain is not detected in xrays please spend a little more n get a clear conclusion about ur issue and go to a specialist for that Particular problem instead of suppressing ur pain with pain killers n steroids\nUr muscle n tendons can be damaged or tear bcz they might b weak or bcz of exertion like heavy work or heavy exercise etc etc\nUr muscles can b weak by any reason and give u trouble\nIt can b bcoz of not proper nutrtion or age or other physical aliments hard work or heavy work etc etc\n\nJust b aware about ur issue and find a perfect specialist for ur particular issue\n\nThanks doctor gajjar and his teamfor everything"

I came to India from Bangladesh  in search of better treatment. So i saw a couple of well-known doctors here but with all honesty, the talk with Dr. Shreyash M. Gajjar made me more confident and feel at ease. He told me to get an arthroscopic surgery after which my leg would be better than ever and I\u2019ll be able to play all sports comfortably again. He did my surgery and gave me instructions to follow for the next few months to heal and get my strength back. I\u2019d say i\u2019m almost there, just need to gain strength by doing exercises that he instructed. In my opinion, he is one of the most helpful and forthcoming doctors ever. He is truly one of the best at what he does. And it\u2019s not just him but his assistant Dr. Nilesh was of great help. Their service is unmatched.

Though during Army service was not scared of bullets but due to this I was in fear. In panic I ran around all renowned hospitals & doctors. I was looking for the Best Doctor & Best Hospital combination. Did all India extensive research & word of mouth survey. *AND I homed onto Dr Gagan Gautam, Uro Onco.* I met him in Medanta Medicity in Jun and found him to be a rare combination of best Head & Heart. I developed so much confidence in him that in just one meeting I said Yes for surgery and fixed up date for surgery.\nFinally I was operated on 15 Jul. A long surgery for 4 hours. Dr Gagan Gautam kept my wife informed all the time during surgery & reassuring her that all was well. After surgery he visited me two times a day, closely followed my recovery and kept my morale up. Not flattering or butteressing he is the Best Dr in India who is most compassionate, most accomodating , deeply involved in his patients, always reassuring, most professional and above all Always with a Smile which helped me to recover. After tryst with him I realized why ' Doctors are next to God'. He is a true Professional Leader and has developed a very dynamic team called 'Team Gagan'.\nIf you believe that Soldiers never Lie, then belive me that he is the 'Best in India'. And yes, I would also like to mention that Medanta Medicity is a State of the art World Class Hospital with top notch Faciliteis and  classic Administration & Management.\nKudos to Medanta, Kudos to Dr Naresh Trehan and above all SALUTE TO DR GAGAN GAUTAM."

It was an uneventful and successful surgery. Post surgery, I am very comfortable and recovering steadily.\n\nDuring my interactions with him, both pre and post-surgery, I found him to be a very pleasant and cheerful doctor who attends his patients with extreme warmth and affection. He listens to them with patience and explains every aspect of the proposed treatment.\n\nI come from a family of doctors (and am one myself) and I can vouch for the fact that I\u2019ve rarely come across a doctor with so much grace and warmth. No matter how hard pressed for time, he and his team go the last mile to ensure that each & every patient is given individual attention to the patient\u2019s entire satisfaction. No wonder he is the most sought after Robotic Onco Urology Surgeon.\n\nPersonally, I feel that Dr Gagan Gautam is an Icon in the field of Robotic Onco Urology Surgery.\nI wish him and his team all the success in their future endeavors and hope they bring more laurels to themselves as well as the country in time to come."

The good Dr. was great to deal with and very clear and concise with any questions i had. All appointments and tests are done promptly. The hospital is run like a well oiled machine.\nSo far so good ie. my full hip replacement surgery, only 3 weeks in mind.\nMy experience in the hospital as a whole with the surgeons and nurses was very good. The staff when I stayed through operation seemed a little inexperienced tho, one orderly was very aggressive on arrival practically ripping my clothes off.\nStill 5 stars tho as my experiences with Dr. Subhash and his main team were excellent and the speed of recovery post op. has been immense."

It is my pleasure to review and express my admiration for the skill and professionalism of Dr. Subhash and his team.\nFrom the moment we arrived at the hospital, it was evident that my wife was in safe hands. The staff provided top notch care. Dr. Subhash and his team were impressive at demonstrating a high level of expertise and dedication to their work.\nDr. Subhash is a highly skilled surgeon with years of experience, who is not only a good doctor but also a superb human being. He was always amiable and approachable. His smiling face and selfless service made my wife feel at home. Dr. Subhash took the time to explain every step of the process to my wife and answered all the questions diligently. His explanation of the process of recovery and the surgery\u2019s after-effects gave us a lot of confidence. He was always patient, encouraging and catered to the surgery with utmost care and precision. We believe my wife\u2019s speedy recovery is remarkable only due to his prowess. Dr. Subhash and his team were professional, compassionate, and attentive throughout the surgery and after. It was evident that they are dedicated to providing the highest possible medical care to their patients.\nA special mention about the anaesthetist (sorry for forgetting the name) who provided my wife with outstanding care. His comprehensive understanding of my wife\u2019s medical history and his ability to tailor the anaesthesia specifically to her needs were praiseworthy. It was his empathetic approach and pain management plans that gave my wife comfort and overall benefited her well-being.\nI would also like to acknowledge the outstanding support of Mr. Rahul Chaudhury who was the department coordinator. I always found Mr. Rahul to be a highly professional individual who went above and beyond his duties to ensure seamless and efficient experience for the patients. His warmth and welcoming demeanour created a positive atmosphere in the waiting area. I am very grateful for the positive attitude he provided me with.\nThe team of physiotherapists consisting of Dr. Shashi, Dr. Priyanka, and Dr. Guntasha; provided my wife with exceptional care and support during her rehabilitation journey. Their knowledge, compassionate approach, individualized treatment plan, skillful therapy sessions and clear communication made a significant impact on my wife\u2019s recovery.\nTo conclude, Dr. Subhash and the team at Fortis Memorial Research Institute are an exceptional group of medical professionals who truly excel in their field. My wife\u2019s successful total knee replacement surgery is testament to their skill, expertise, and dedication. Thank you, Dr. Subhash and team, for providing us the best medical care we could have hoped for."

It was a failure. I am in intense pain now. I visited him several times, and he said, \"I will take out the plate and insert a new plate\". How can I trust him - he had me under full anesthesia and had all the freedom to solve my fracture. He did not. I am sorry to be blunt, but my experience has been poor with Dr. Jaggi."

My son met with an accident, he was given firstaid at Max and was advised to meet dr. Jaggi for a check up after 5 days. He straightway asked if I have insurance coverage. I said yes, he said the child needs to be operated. Dr. Jaggi didnt even ask to unwrap the soft plastering to see the hand condition etc. I was taken aback as the junior doctors in Max itself said that the injury was minor. We consulted another doctor at a different place and he also said that the child was recovering fast. No need for any surgery.\nDr. Jaggi to me is an example of an extreme money minded person with low integrity."

When we were desperately in need of advice regarding my condition (increased size of right ventricle due to absence of pulmonary valve as a result of TOF surgery on birth), we thought of seeking his expert opinion. He performed the necessary checkups and explained the whole situation patiently and in a way that even someone with no medical background would be able to understand. On his advice we flew to MMM Hospital in Chennai and I had the surgery done under expert care. The whole situation was handled professionally and smoothly and a large part of that was due to Dr. Anil Singhi."

I took him to hospital and doctor admitted him to icu, i told them all the medicines prescribed by dr.amit pendhakar-- trust me doctor was shocked and he told me because of these medicines only my dadaji bp and sugar fluctuated to this level..he immediately stopped these medicines and then i went to aakash hospital confronting dr. Amit pendhakar on this, there i come to know we are not the only victim of his money making tricks, but there were so many patients complaining about the same issue.

I knew Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in coincidence; it was after I told that my daughter could not get medical treatment in domestic medication for her sickness of heart and shall go to foreign country to be treated. A person knows our problem has recommended me that there is a good doctor named Suresh Rao who is working in Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and can help my daughter and also he gave us the address of the doctor to search and know about him. I decided to take my daughter to there and let her get the medical treatment after I observed the knowledge and experience of the doctor. Then we send them the medical documents of my daughter and they answered me that they are happy to help her. I went to India Mumbai by agreeing on the medical cost they stated. Dr. Suresh Rao was seen my daughter on the 3rd day she enrolled to the Hospital, my daughter has a problem of Mitral valve get narrowed and the only solution told to me from the domestic doctor is to make replacement of the valve with artificial valve. But there fraud action started here, they told me that the medication for her age in this Hospital is widening the valve as much as possible and they are not going to replace the valve. I have had a chance to choose the other hospital if they were told me this idea when I was in my country. Later on, I understood that the woman named Nidhi Patel who is in Assistant international marketing department was answering to our Email by the name of the Dr. Suresh Rao himself when I was there in my country. But I had no option and I agreed with idea as I assume the medical treatment is for sure better than the domestic medical treatment and my daughter was operated at her age of two years and seven months and also she recovered after some days. Then I was happy and the Dr. Told me that my daughters good and I can go back to my country, but my daughter starts manifesting the symptoms she has before the surgery right after a couple of days the Dr. Told me she is well. But my daughter begins to go to ICU for she has no change. She was taking a kind of medicine taken through mouth while the symptom manifestation is there, they changed the medicine to injector and the symptom hide for a time being and manifest after some days. I never expect this from the Dr. Said to have much more experience. I started scare, my daughter continue going to ICU without any additional help, and the Dr. was very careless toward her. One day I told that my daughter has discharged from the Hospital without any recovery by signature of the Dr. Never seen her, I never get anybody to hear me even though I tell she is not recovered from the sickness. I was alone going out of my country and I never assume this incidence will in country, then I got out of there by having  my daughter for  I cannot go any were without my daughter. These all actions were to let me pay more money. She discharged on September 29/2017 and readmit on October 1/2017 for the sickness aggravate, whoever but she never get unique help other than getting the medicine into her body through injector. I took my daughter to foreign country for better medical treatment but she started to suffer even more. She stayed in Hospital for long time by going to I CU for more than 35 days in Hospital in the same condition. I told that she need another surgery after the doctor used to follow up her in domestic hospital has talked to Dr. Suresh Rao in telephone call and convinced him for she had no change. My daughter never need the second surgery if the doctor was use his knowledge and experience on the first surgery. They requested me additional money by their fault and I shocked. I never expect that they cruelly snatch this much by the name medical treatment especially to the cost of child\u2019s life even though I knew some Indians fraud. I was very worry because the cost was beyond the plan and they told me it is not possible even though I asked them to minimize the cost."

Do not explain you anything about your problem rather will write you prescription and says next(in signals to her assistant) where you are spending 500 consultancy fee.\nShe will hardly give you 2-3 minutes. Even after asking about, Ma\u2019am? What the problem is? She will give you stringent reply. And wants you to get up and get going so that she can see maximum number of patients who are going to pay 500 each for money obviously. It is earning money thing rather than treating patients in clear words.\nMa\u2019am. If you\u2019re reading this.\nI am truly disappointed\nI had to ask about other things aswell but your behaviour made me forget some of that.\nYou need to give if you take.\nIt should not only be business."

He explains things with so much clarity and patience. I must say it was the best decision taken for me.\nThey are so kind and treated me like a baby for the  15- 20 days I was admitted. Post 6 months now I can say my surgery has been successful. And by god's grace I was in the best hands.

The hygene standard they maintain is awesome. Sometimes I wonder how reasonable they are  giving their goods and services to the customers where other institutions in the same profession is looting people.\nComing to Staffs,they are very caring,generous and have a human touch, specially Mr Ishwar, Zahir and all of them whose names I don't know.\nI am sure Mr Bain and team would go a very long way because of their ethics and honesty that they shower on everyone that visits.

One of my distant relatives came to Delhi NCR trying to get admission for a brain tumor surgery in AIIMS. But the waiting list was huge. They were not very financially well off also. A friend suggested about Dr. Harnarayan Singh. We met him and the surgery was advised on an urgent basis as the tumor was looking like cancer. The surgery was done successfully and it was confirmed that the tumour was cancerous, Glioblastoma multiforme. The hospital billing was also very helpful about the finances as well.  After the surgery, they went back to their home place and continued further treatment in Patna. They are in regular touch with the doctor through tele-consultation. It was an amazing experience.

Even though he had successfully treated spinal issues but he took an extra mile of effort and was always involved with further treatment of VRSA which was the domain of infection specialist.

I was very skeptical during my first visit after my initial diagnosis by my GP, but Dr. Santosh patiently explained the situation and the possible options including surgical. In the entire pre-operative and post-operative phase, his entire team was very supportive and put me at ease. The operation went off very well and I can confidently say that I was in safest hands with Dr. Santosh. Unlike most senior doctors, Dr. Santosh was always available to answer queries personally and on the phone and most importantly he and his team gave regular updates to my family during the operation.\n\nThank you Doctor and your entire team for the treatment and all the care!"

        "text": "I am delighted to have the opportunity of giving a feedback here.\n\nI have always been saying since I visited Dr. Santosh's team in KDAH that he and his subordinate doctors in the team are totally devoted to the profession and cooperative with the patients as I felt in my case. The successful robotic surgery of my renal cancerous tumor is proof of it. And the best thing was the way Dr. Santosh and other doctors, specifically Dr. Vibushit encouraged me to fight with the post surgery discomforts. That helped me a lot to have a quick recovery. I am really grateful.\n\nIt would be unfair if I don't mention one thing. I believe you expect an honest opinion from me. My experiences with most of the nursing staff who were on duty during my admission period were not good. I would say they are not properly trained. Some of them looked like they were reluctant to serve the patients. The patients have to take care on their own whether the fluid/injection is actually passing or not, if it is already finished! Would be good if the doctors can take care of these things and ensure nursing for the patients.\n\nIn the end, thank you Dr. Santosh, very much for helping me to get rid of the worst situation of my life."

I contacted Dr. Santosh Waigankar on phone (reference given by local surgeon) and he and his team very nicely responded and everything was arranged including the date of surgery.. I reached Kokilaben hospital and he and his team personally did everything and the surgery was done successfully in time. Post operative care was also very good. Now I am doing well after surgery. I am very much satisfied with his team's personal approach and good care. I thank him and his team and wish them all the best in future.  Dr. Mohan Chachondia. Physician, Nagpur."

It was easier for us to understand the minute details of the ailment and how the treatment would be like. Even during surgery he would update us timely about what is going on inside the OT and that eases a lot of tension during major operations. A confident doctor, with good command in his domain.\n\nSpecial mention to Dr. Varun and Dr. Aakash who made the process easier for us during this tough time. Always approachable, they add up to form a great team along with Dr. Santosh.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dr. Santosh."

I don't know why he force everybody for fibroscan. He just gave himself every award and always bragging about his thesis about stages of liver cancer in Argentina. Selling generic medicine on very high cost. I will never visit him and advice anyone to go. This is my opinion totally."
